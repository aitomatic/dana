# Compound Assignment Implementation Test Checklist

## Implementation Summary
Added support for compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to the Dana language.

## Files Modified
1. `dana/core/lang/parser/dana_grammar.lark` - Added grammar rules
2. `dana/core/lang/ast/__init__.py` - Added CompoundAssignment AST node
3. `dana/core/lang/parser/transformer/statement/assignment_transformer.py` - Added transformation logic
4. `dana/core/lang/interpreter/executor/statement_executor.py` - Added execution handler
5. `dana/core/lang/interpreter/executor/statement/assignment_handler.py` - Added compound assignment execution
6. Documentation files updated

## Test Coverage Needed

### 1. Parser Tests
- [x] Created: `tests/unit/core/lang/parser/test_compound_assignment.py`
  - Tests parsing of all operators (+=, -=, *=, /=)
  - Tests with simple variables
  - Tests with scoped variables (private:, public:, etc.)
  - Tests with complex targets (subscripts, attributes)

### 2. Execution Tests
- [x] Created: Execution tests in `test_compound_assignment.py`
  - Simple arithmetic operations
  - Operations with expressions on RHS
  - List element updates
  - Dictionary value updates
  - String concatenation with +=
  - Return value testing
  - Error handling (undefined variables, type mismatches)

### 3. Integration Tests
- [x] Created: `tests/functional/language/test_compound_assignments.na`
  - Real Dana code testing all operators
  - Loop integration
  - Conditional integration
  - Function integration

### 4. Regression Testing Required
Run these existing test suites to ensure no regressions:
```bash
# Parser tests
pytest tests/unit/core/lang/parser/test_dana_parser.py -xvs
pytest tests/unit/core/lang/parser/test_ast_validation.py -xvs

# Transformer tests  
pytest tests/unit/core/lang/parser/transformer/test_dana_transformer.py -xvs

# Interpreter tests
pytest tests/unit/core/lang/interpreter/test_dana_interpreter.py -xvs
pytest tests/unit/core/lang/interpreter/executor/test_statement_executor.py -xvs

# Functional tests
pytest tests/functional/language/ -xvs
```

### 5. Edge Cases to Verify
- [ ] Compound assignment with None/null values (should error)
- [ ] Type coercion (int += float, etc.)
- [ ] Operator precedence in RHS expressions
- [ ] Nested compound assignments
- [ ] Compound assignments in comprehensions (if supported)
- [ ] Thread safety (if applicable)

### 6. Performance Considerations
- Compound assignments should ideally be more efficient than `x = x + 1`
- No significant performance regression in regular assignments

## Manual Testing Commands
```bash
# Run the Dana REPL and test:
bin/dana repl

# Test commands:
x = 10
x += 5
print(x)  # Should print 15

arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr[0] += 10
print(arr)  # Should print [11, 2, 3]

# Run example file:
bin/dana run examples/dana/01_language_basics/05_compound_assignments.na
```

## Pre-merge Checklist
- [x] All new tests pass
- [x] No regression in existing tests  
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Example code works correctly
- [x] Grammar and parsing working
- [x] AST transformation working
- [x] Interpreter execution working
- [x] Type checker support added

## Notes
- Implementation follows KISS principle
- Reuses existing assignment infrastructure
- Consistent with Dana's design patterns
- No backward compatibility issues (new feature)
