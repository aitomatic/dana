    "# State Management in OpenDXA\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Understanding of OpenDXA basics (from [Introduction to OpenDXA](../01_getting_started/01_introduction_to_dxa.ipynb))\n",
    "- Familiarity with Agent concepts ([Agent Basics](./01_agent_basics.ipynb) - *assuming this exists or will exist*)\n",
    "- OpenDXA package installed\n",
    "- Python 3.8 or higher"

    "## 1. Understanding the Agent State (Blackboard)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each OpenDXA Agent maintains an internal state, often referred to conceptually as a **Blackboard**. This blackboard acts as a central repository for information gathered, generated, or required during the agent's operation. It allows different parts of the agent (like the planning and reasoning layers, or various tools/capabilities) to communicate and share context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state is typically accessed via the `agent.state` attribute (or a similar mechanism depending on the specific implementation)."

    "## 2. Private vs. Shared State (Conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the exact implementation might vary, it's useful to think of the state as having two conceptual parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Private Blackboard:** Contains information primarily internal to the agent's own reasoning process. This might include intermediate thoughts, detailed step breakdowns, or temporary variables.\n",
    "*   **Shared Blackboard:** Contains information intended to be accessible more broadly, perhaps across different agent components (like planning and reasoning outputs) or even potentially by other agents or external systems in more complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction helps manage the flow and scope of information within the agent architecture."
