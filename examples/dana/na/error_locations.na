# Initialize private scope
private.initialized = True  # Now supporting Python-style booleans

# Example 1: Division by zero
# private.result = 10 / 0

# Example 2: Undefined variable (after private scope is initialized)
# private.result = private.undefined_var

# Example 3: Invalid operator (string multiplication)
# private.result = "hello" * "world"

# Example 4: Nested error
private.result = (10 / 0) + 5
