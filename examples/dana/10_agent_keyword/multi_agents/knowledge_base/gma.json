(e.g., chamber pressure, process endpoint, plasma emission, etc.)\n- **Check process context:** Is CHF3 flow expected to cause a change in this signal at this process step?\n\n## 2. **Initial Data Review**\n- **Review FDC/SPC data** for CHF3 MFC:\n  - Look at the CHF3_MFC setpoint vs. actual flow trend.\n  - Check for any **SPIKE**, **DROP**, **FLUCTUATED**, or **LEVEL-SHIFT** patterns in the CHF3_MFC signal.\n  - Compare with historical data for the same recipe/step.\n\n## 3. **Alarm and Event Log Check**\n- **Check for any alarms or warnings** related to the CHF3 MFC:\n  - MFC deviation alarms (flow out of tolerance)\n  - MFC communication errors\n  - Process step aborts or holds due to gas flow issues\n\n## 4. **Direct MFC Performance Verification**\n- **Observe the CHF3 MFC during process:**\n  - Is the actual flow matching the setpoint within control limits (±1% of setpoint, per documentation)?\n  - Is the response time to setpoint changes <500ms?\n  - Is the flow stable (no excessive noise or drift)?\n\n- **If possible, run a manual MFC flow test:**\n  - Set the MFC to several flow points (e.g., 0%, 50%, 100% of typical process value).\n  - Observe actual flow readings and stability at each point.\n  - Check for **drift** (slow change away from setpoint) or **instability** (oscillation, noise).\n\n## 5. **Cross-Parameter Correlation**\n- **Check related process signals:**\n  - Chamber pressure: Does it respond to CHF3 flow changes?\n  - Optical emission (if available): Does CHF3 introduction cause expected spectral changes?\n  - Endpoint signals: Are they delayed or missing when CHF3 is flowing?\n\n- **Compare with other MFCs:** Are other gas flows behaving normally? If only CHF3 is abnormal, this points to a CHF3-specific issue.\n\n## 6. **Physical Inspection**\n- **Inspect the CHF3 MFC and gas lines:**\n  - Look for leaks, kinks, or blockages.\n  - Check for condensation or contamination in the lines.\n  - Ensure all electrical and pneumatic connections are secure.\n\n## 7. **Calibration and Maintenance History**\n- **Check the last calibration date** for the CHF3 MFC.\n- **Review maintenance records:** Any recent work on the MFC or gas panel?\n- **If overdue for calibration or recent issues are noted,** this increases suspicion of drift/instability.\n\n## 8. **Test with Reference Flow (if available)**\n- **If a reference flow meter is available:**\n  - Compare CHF3 MFC reading to the reference.\n  - Significant deviation (>1% of setpoint) indicates drift.\n\n## 9. **Process of Elimination**\n- **If all other process parameters and hardware are normal,** and only CHF3 flow is abnormal, this strengthens the case for MFC drift/instability.\n\n## 10. **Decision and Next Steps**\n- **If CHF3 MFC is confirmed to be drifting or unstable:**\n  - Tag the MFC as suspect.\n  - Schedule calibration or replacement.\n  - Document findings and corrective actions.\n\n- **If CHF3 MFC is performing within specification:**\n  - Investigate other possible root causes (e.g., process recipe, valve operation, downstream restrictions, sensor issues).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Step | Action | Pass/Fail Criteria | Next Action |\n|------|--------|--------------------|-------------|\n| 1 | Confirm symptom | Signal should change with CHF3 flow | Proceed if not |\n| 2 | Review FDC/SPC | No abnormal patterns | If abnormal, suspect MFC |\n| 3 | Check alarms | No MFC alarms | If alarms, suspect MFC |\n| 4 | Manual flow test | Flow matches setpoint, stable | If not, suspect MFC |\n| 5 | Cross-check signals | Other gases/processes normal | If only CHF3 abnormal, suspect MFC |\n| 6 | Physical inspection | No issues found | If issues, repair/replace |\n| 7 | Calibration check | Calibration up to date | If not, calibrate |\n| 8 | Reference flow | Matches MFC reading | If not, suspect MFC |\n| 9 | Elimination | All else normal | If so, MFC is root cause |\n| 10 | Decision | MFC confirmed or ruled out | Take corrective action |\n\n---\n\n**Remind the junior engineer:**  \n- Always document each step and finding.\n- If in doubt, consult with a senior engineer before replacing or recalibrating the MFC.\n- Safety first: CHF3 is toxic—follow all gas safety protocols during inspection or testing.\n\n---\n\n**If you follow this process, you will be able to confidently determine whether CHF3 MFC drift or instability is the root cause of the signal anomaly.**",

(OES, RF, pressure, etc.)\n   - **When**: During which process step or recipe phase does this occur?\n   - **History**: Has this symptom appeared before? Is it repeatable?\n\n### 2. **Collect and Review Data**\n   - **Gather**: Retrieve recent process logs, endpoint detection data, and alarm/event history for affected runs.\n   - **Compare**: Look at both \"good\" (normal) and \"bad\" (symptom-present) runs.\n   - **Check**: Are there any endpoint alarms, early terminations, or abnormal endpoint times?\n\n### 3. **Check Endpoint Algorithm Configuration**\n   - **Algorithm Type**: Identify which endpoint algorithm is in use (e.g., OES peak, ratio, derivative, RF inflection, etc.).\n   - **Sensitivity Settings**: Review the current sensitivity/threshold settings in the endpoint detection configuration.\n   - **Change History**: Has anyone recently changed these settings? Check change logs or with process engineers.\n\n### 4. **Analyze Signal Behavior**\n   - **Trend Analysis**: Plot the raw endpoint signal (e.g., OES intensity, RF bias, pressure) for several wafers.\n   - **Expected Change**: Is there a real, physical change in the signal at the expected endpoint, or is the signal flat/noisy?\n   - **Algorithm Response**: Does the endpoint algorithm trigger on small, insignificant fluctuations (i.e., is it \"jumping\" on noise)?\n\n### 5. **Test for Over-Sensitivity**\n   - **Simulate**: If possible, run the endpoint algorithm in \"monitor\" mode (not controlling the process) and observe if it triggers prematurely or erratically.\n   - **Adjust**: Temporarily increase the threshold or reduce the sensitivity (e.g., require a larger signal change, longer confirmation window).\n   - **Observe**: Does the signal now change as expected, or does the algorithm still trigger too early/late?\n\n### 6. **Correlate with Process Results**\n   - **Wafer Inspection**: Check if wafers processed with the current endpoint settings show signs of under- or over-processing.\n   - **Process Data**: Compare endpoint times and signal changes to process results (e.g., etch depth, uniformity).\n\n### 7. **Rule Out Other Causes**\n   - **Sensor Health**: Ensure the endpoint sensor (OES, RF, pressure) is functioning and calibrated.\n   - **Process Stability**: Confirm that the process itself is stable and producing expected byproducts/signals.\n   - **Recipe Consistency**: Make sure the recipe and chamber conditions are consistent with previous successful runs.\n\n### 8. **Decision Point**\n   - **If**: The endpoint algorithm triggers on noise or very small signal changes, and increasing the threshold restores expected signal behavior,\n     - **Then**: The root cause is likely \"Endpoint_algorithm_too_sensitive.\"\n   - **If Not**: If the signal itself is not changing (even with less sensitive settings), the root cause is elsewhere (e.g., process issue, sensor failure).\n\n### 9. **Document Findings**\n   - Record all data, settings, and observations.\n   - Note any changes made and their effects.\n   - Summarize whether \"Endpoint_algorithm_too_sensitive\" is confirmed or ruled out.\n\n---\n\n**Key Reminders for the Junior Engineer:**\n- Always back up current settings before making changes.\n- Only adjust sensitivity in a controlled, reversible way.\n- Communicate findings and actions to your team and process owner.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Step | Action | What to Look For |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| 1 | Clarify symptom | Which signal, when, history |\n| 2 | Collect data | Logs, trends, alarms |\n| 3 | Check config | Algorithm type, sensitivity, changes |\n| 4 | Analyze signal | Real change vs. noise, algorithm response |\n| 5 | Test sensitivity | Simulate, adjust, observe |\n| 6 | Correlate | Wafer/process results |\n| 7 | Rule out others | Sensor, process, recipe |\n| 8 | Decide | Is sensitivity the root cause? |\n| 9 | Document | Record all findings |\n\n---\n\n**If you need help with any step, ask your senior or process engineer for guidance.**",

Check the FDC system logs for the time and frequency of the reflected power alarm.\n  - Note the actual reflected power value and compare it to the threshold (e.g., >5% of forward power, VSWR >1.3:1).\n\n- **Check process context:**  \n  - Identify which process step(s) the alarm occurs in.\n  - Note the set RF power, chamber pressure, and recipe step.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **RF Drift Assessment**\n\n- **Review RF power stability:**  \n  - Use FDC data (RF-POWER, RF-REFLECT, RF-PHASE sensors, 100ms sampling).\n  - Look for gradual or sudden changes in delivered RF power, phase, or reflected power over time.\n  - Compare current data to baseline (historical) runs for the same recipe and chamber.\n\n- **Check for RF generator issues:**  \n  - Confirm RF generator output is stable (±1% accuracy, ±2° phase).\n  - Review generator self-diagnostics for faults or warnings.\n  - Ensure no recent changes to generator settings or firmware.\n\n- **Inspect matching network:**  \n  -

Look for correlation:  \n    - Does a pressure dip or spike coincide with a reflected power increase?\n    - Does RF drift (power or phase) occur simultaneously with pressure instability?\n\n- **Check for repeatability:**  \n  - Does the issue occur every run, or is it intermittent?\n  - Is it specific to certain recipes, steps, or chambers?\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Eliminate Other Common Causes**\n\n- **Cable/connection check:**  \n  - Visually inspect all RF cables and connectors for damage, oxidation, or loose connections (see 5.3.1).\n  - Verify torque and continuity.\n  - Rule out cable/connector as the primary cause.\n\n- **Grounding system check:**  \n  -

Ensure matching network is not the limiting factor.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Test and Confirm**\n\n- **Stabilize pressure:**  \n  - If pressure instability is observed, run a test with pressure setpoint held constant and monitor reflected power.\n  - If reflected power stabilizes, pressure instability is a likely contributor.\n\n- **Stabilize RF:**  \n  - If RF drift is observed, run a test with a known good generator and matching network, or swap with a matched chamber if possible.\n  - If reflected power stabilizes, RF drift is a likely contributor.\n\n- **Combined test:**  \n  - If both pressure and RF drift are present, address one at a time to isolate the effect.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Conclusion**\n\n- **If:**  \n  - Reflected power spikes coincide with pressure instability and/or RF drift,  \n  - Other causes (cable, ground, matching network) are ruled out,  \n  - Stabilizing pressure and/or RF eliminates the symptom,\n\n**→ Then:**  \nRF_drift_plus_low_pressure_instability is confirmed as the root cause.\n\n- **If not:**  \n  -

This is based on best practices and the relevant documentation.\n\n---\n\n# Diagnostic Procedure: Chamber Pressure Fluctuates – Is APC Drift or Miscalibration the Root Cause?\n\n## 1. **Symptom Confirmation**\n- **Verify the symptom:** Review FDC/SPC data to confirm that chamber pressure is fluctuating outside control limits (typically ±5% for process, ±1% for stability).\n- **Check for pattern:** Is the fluctuation random, periodic, or stepwise? Note the time scale (short, long, during recipe transitions, etc.).\n\n## 2. **Initial System Checks**\n- **Check process recipe:** Ensure the setpoint and ramp rates are correct and consistent with the intended process.\n- **Confirm sensor readings:** Compare chamber pressure readings from the main sensor and any backup/reference sensors, if available.\n\n## 3. **APC (Automatic Pressure Controller) Functionality Check**\n- **Observe APC operation:**\n  - Watch the throttle valve position in real time during pressure fluctuations.\n  - Is the valve hunting (rapidly opening/closing) or stuck?\n- **Check APC control mode:**\n  - Is the APC in automatic or manual mode? (Should be automatic for normal process.)\n  - Is the control loop enabled and not overridden by another system?\n\n## 4. **Sensor and Calibration Verification**\n- **Pressure sensor calibration:**\n  - Check the last calibration date and compare to schedule (should be quarterly or after maintenance).\n  - If possible, perform a zero/span check using a reference gauge or test gas.\n- **Sensor drift check:**\n  - Compare current readings to historical baseline at known conditions (e.g., base vacuum, atmosphere).\n  - If available, swap to a backup sensor and see if the fluctuation persists.\n\n## 5. **APC Controller Health**\n- **Controller self-diagnostics:**\n  - Review APC controller logs for errors, warnings, or drift compensation events.\n  - Check for recent firmware updates or parameter changes.\n- **PID tuning check:**\n  - Review control loop parameters (PID values). Have they changed recently? Are they within recommended ranges?\n  - If possible, temporarily switch to default PID settings and observe pressure stability.\n\n## 6. **Mechanical and Electrical Checks**\n- **Throttle valve inspection:**\n  - Listen for abnormal noises (sticking, grinding).\n  - Check for physical obstructions or leaks around the valve.\n- **Actuator and feedback:**\n  - Verify actuator response to control signals.\n  - Check feedback signal integrity (no noise, dropouts).\n\n## 7. **Process of Elimination**\n- **Isolate APC from other causes:**\n  - Confirm that gas flows, pump performance, and chamber leaks are within normal range.\n  - If possible, run a dry cycle (no wafer, no process gases) and observe pressure control.\n  - If pressure still fluctuates, APC is likely at fault.\n\n## 8. **Decision Criteria**\n- **If you observe:**\n  - Pressure sensor readings are inconsistent or drift over time.\n  - Throttle valve is hunting or not responding smoothly.\n  - APC controller logs show drift, errors, or require frequent recalibration.\n  - Pressure fluctuations persist even in dry runs or with default PID settings.\n- **Then:** APC drift or miscalibration is likely the root cause.\n\n- **If you observe:**\n  - Pressure is stable with backup sensor or after recalibration.\n  - Fluctuations disappear after PID retuning or controller reset.\n  - Fluctuations only occur during specific process steps (e.g., gas transitions).\n- **Then:** APC drift/miscalibration is confirmed as the root cause.\n\n- **If not:** Investigate other causes (e.g., gas flow instability, pump issues, chamber leaks).\n\n## 9. **Documentation**\n- Record all findings, actions, and test results.\n- Note calibration status, PID settings, and any changes made.\n- If APC drift/miscalibration is confirmed, schedule recalibration or controller maintenance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Step | Action | Pass/Fail | Next Step |\n|------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1 | Confirm symptom | Fluctuation present | 2 |\n| 2 | Check recipe/sensor | OK | 3 |\n| 3 | Observe APC | Valve hunting/unstable | 4 |\n| 4 | Sensor calibration | Out of spec | 5 |\n| 5 | Controller health | Errors/drift | 6 |\n| 6 | Mechanical check | Valve/actuator OK | 7 |\n| 7 | Eliminate other causes | Fluctuation persists | 8 |\n| 8 | Decision | Criteria met | Confirm root cause |\n\n---\n\n**Tip for Junior Engineer:**  \nAlways document each step, and if in doubt, consult with a senior engineer before making hardware adjustments or recalibrating the APC.\n\n---\n\n**If APC drift or miscalibration is confirmed:**  \n- Perform full sensor recalibration.\n- Retune PID parameters as per procedure.\n- Verify pressure stability post-maintenance before releasing tool to production.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need a printable checklist or troubleshooting flowchart!",

If the pressure rises faster, a leak is likely present.\n- **Compare to Baseline:** Compare the leak rate to historical baseline data for this chamber.\n\n## 5. **Localized Leak Detection**\n- **Use a Helium Leak Detector:** Connect a calibrated helium leak detector to the vacuum system.\n- **Spray Helium:** Systematically spray helium around all vacuum line joints, flanges, and suspected leak points while monitoring the detector.\n- **Identify Leak Location:** A spike in the detector reading indicates the presence and location of a leak.\n\n## 6. **Check Vacuum Pump and Valves**\n- **Pump Performance:** Verify that the vacuum pump is operating within specification (check base pressure, pumpdown time, and noise/vibration).\n- **Valve Integrity:** Inspect throttle and isolation valves for proper operation and sealing.\n\n## 7. **Review System Data and Correlate**\n- **Trend Analysis:** Review historical chamber pressure data for patterns (e.g., sudden spikes, gradual drifts, or step changes).\n- **Cross-Check with Other Parameters:** Check for correlated fluctuations in other parameters (e.g., gas flow, throttle valve position) that might indicate a leak or other root cause.\n\n## 8. **Document Findings**\n- **Record All Observations:** Note all test results, leak locations (if found), and any abnormal findings.\n- **Photograph Evidence:** Take photos of any visible damage or leak points for documentation.\n\n## 9. **Conclusion and Next Steps**\n- **If Leak is Confirmed:** Document the location and severity. Plan for repair (tighten fittings, replace gaskets, repair/replace damaged lines).\n- **If No Leak is Found:** Consider other root causes (e.g., pressure control system faults, pump degradation, process gas supply issues) and proceed with further diagnostics as per troubleshooting guidelines.\n\n---\n\n**Key Points from Documentation:**\n- Acceptable leak rate: <1 mTorr/min at operating pressure.\n- Use helium leak detection for pinpointing leaks.\n- Always compare to baseline performance.\n- Document all steps and findings for traceability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for Junior Engineer:**  \nFollow this procedure step by step.

Is there a drift (>±2% for etch, >±5% for deposition)?\n  - Check for sudden drops or gradual drifts in RF power during the process.\n  - Review FDC trends for RF-POWER, RF-REFLECT, and RF-PHASE for instability or drift.\n\n### b. **VSWR and Reflection**\n  - Is VSWR within normal limits (<1.3:1)? Any excursions above 1.5:1?\n  - Is reflected power increasing during pressure fluctuations?\n  - Any evidence of arcing, matching network hunting, or generator trips?\n\n### c. **RF Generator and Matching Network**\n  - Check for generator or matching network alarms.\n  - Review matching network tuning speed and stability (should be <500ms, no excessive hunting).\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Check for Low Pressure Instability**\n\n### a. **Pressure Control System**\n  - Is the pressure control loop (throttle valve, pressure sensor, pump) stable when RF is OFF?\n  - Does pressure only fluctuate when RF is ON?

Compare to the maximum allowable (typically <0.2mm).\n   - **Photograph Findings:** Take clear photos for documentation and comparison.\n\n## 5. **Component Condition Assessment**\n   - **Focus Ring & Shields:** Inspect for excessive polymer, erosion, or deposits.\n   - **Upper Electrode:** Check for polymer on the showerhead and in gas distribution holes.\n   - **O-Rings/Seals:** Look for polymer encroachment that could affect vacuum or RF return.\n\n## 6. **Particle and Residue Analysis**\n   - **Wipe Test:** If allowed, perform a wipe test on chamber walls to check for loose or sticky polymer.\n   - **Residue Sampling:** Collect a small sample of the polymer (if possible) for FTIR or EDX analysis to confirm it matches the post-etch wafer residue.\n\n## 7. **Process Correlation**\n   - **Wafer Location Mapping:** Correlate wafer residue patterns with chamber wall buildup locations (e.g., edge polymer on wafer matches edge buildup in chamber).\n   - **Uniformity Impact:** Check if process uniformity (CD, etch rate) has drifted, which can be a sign of chamber wall effects.\n\n## 8. **Compare to Known Failure Modes**\n   - **Reference Fault History:** Review previous cases (e.g., #CHAM-2024-0042) where chamber wall polymer caused similar symptoms.\n   - **Check for Process Drift:** Look for gradual increase in polymer-related issues as RF hours accumulate.\n\n## 9. **Decision Point**\n   - **If Significant Polymer Buildup is Found:**\n     - Buildup exceeds recommended thickness or is visually obvious.\n     - Buildup composition matches wafer residue.\n     - Process drift or uniformity issues are present.\n     - **→ Polymer buildup on chamber wall is likely the root cause.**\n   - **If Chamber is Clean or Buildup is Minimal:**\n     - No significant deposits found.\n     - Buildup does not match wafer residue.\n     - **→ Investigate other root causes (e.g., process recipe, gas flows, wafer loading).**\n\n## 10. **Corrective Action (if confirmed)**\n   - **Schedule Chamber Clean:** Perform full wet and/or plasma clean per procedure.\n   - **Replace/Inspect Process Kit Components:** Focus ring, shield ring, and other parts as needed.\n   - **Document Findings:** Update maintenance and fault tracking systems.\n   - **Run Test Wafers:** Verify symptom is resolved post-clean.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table: Key Checks**\n\n| Step | What to Check | Pass/Fail Criteria |\n|------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Visual Inspection | Polymer on walls, focus ring, shields | <0.2mm, minimal visible |\n| Component Condition | Erosion, deposits | Within spec, no heavy buildup |\n| Residue Match | Chamber vs. wafer | Same composition |\n| Process Data | Drift, uniformity | Stable, within baseline |\n| Maintenance Interval | RF hours since last clean | <1000 RF hours |\n\n---\n\n**Reminders for Junior Engineer:**\n- Always follow safety and cleanroom protocols.\n- Document everything with photos and notes.\n- If unsure, escalate to senior engineer with your findings and documentation.\n\n---\n\n**If you follow this process, you will be able to confidently determine if polymer buildup on the chamber wall is the root cause of excess polymer post-etch.**",

**Confirm the SPC Pattern:**  \n     - Review the SPC charts and logs to confirm the presence of a **systematic shift** (LEVEL-SHIFT or sustained mean shift >2σ from baseline, duration >20 sampling periods).\n     - Note the affected parameters (e.g., wafer temperature, process rate, uniformity).\n\n## 2. **Initial Data Review**\n   - **Check ESC Temperature Control Parameters:**  \n     - Retrieve recent logs for **ESC heater setpoint**, **actual ESC temperature**, and **wafer temperature**.\n     - Compare actual ESC temperature to setpoint and control limits (±0.5°C accuracy, ±1°C uniformity).\n     - Look for deviations, drifts, or out-of-range conditions.\n\n   - **Review SPC Alarms:**  \n     - Check for any recent alarms or warnings related to ESC temperature (e.g., “ESC temperature out of range”, “thermal non-uniformity”, “temperature ramp overshoot”).\n\n## 3. **Pattern Correlation**\n   - **Time Correlation:**  \n     - Align the timing of the SPC systematic shift with any ESC temperature excursions or alarms.\n     - Confirm if the shift in process parameters coincides with ESC temperature deviations.\n\n   - **Parameter Correlation:**  \n     - Check if other process parameters (etch rate, uniformity, CD) also show shifts that could be explained by temperature changes.\n\n## 4. **Direct ESC Temperature System Checks**\n   - **Sensor Readings:**  \n     - Verify readings from all ESC temperature sensors (center, middle, edge).\n     - Check for sensor agreement and outliers (should be within ±1°C across wafer).\n     - If possible, use a calibrated external temperature mapping wafer to cross-check system readings.\n\n   - **Heater Output and Control:**  \n     - Confirm heater output is within expected range for the setpoint.\n     - Check for control system errors, excessive ramp rates, or overshoot (>0.5°C not allowed).\n     - Review recent temperature ramps for compliance with ramp rate and overshoot specs.\n\n## 5. **ESC System Health Checks**\n   - **Helium Backside Cooling:**  \n     - Check helium flow and pressure logs for both zones.\n     - Ensure flow is <2 sccm at operating pressure and leak rate is <0.5 sccm.\n     - High helium flow or leak alarms may indicate poor wafer contact, affecting temperature control.\n\n   - **ESC Power Supply:**  \n     - Review chuck voltage stability (±1% of setpoint).\n     - Check for recent power supply alarms or maintenance records.\n     - Instability here can cause temperature control issues.\n\n## 6. **Calibration and Maintenance Review**\n   - **Temperature Calibration Records:**  \n     - Check last ESC temperature calibration date and results.\n     - Confirm calibration was within acceptance criteria (±1°C accuracy, ±2°C uniformity).\n     - If calibration is overdue or failed, schedule recalibration.\n\n   - **ESC Surface Condition:**  \n     - Review recent PM/inspection records for ESC surface.\n     - Surface damage or contamination can cause temperature non-uniformity.\n\n## 7. **Process and Recipe Review**\n   - **Recipe Setpoints:**  \n     - Confirm that recipe temperature setpoints are correct and consistent with process requirements.\n     - Check for recent recipe changes that could explain the shift.\n\n   - **Process Step Correlation:**  \n     - Determine if the shift occurs at specific process steps or is present throughout.\n\n## 8. **Rule Out Other Causes**\n   - **Check for Other Systematic Issues:**  \n     - Review other critical parameters (RF power, chamber pressure, gas flows) for concurrent shifts.\n     - If multiple unrelated parameters are shifting, consider broader system issues.\n\n## 9. **Decision and Documentation**\n   - **If ESC Heater Temp is Out of Range:**  \n     - If you find ESC temperature consistently out of range, with time and parameter correlation to the SPC shift, this is likely the root cause.\n     - Document findings, including data plots, alarm logs, and calibration records.\n     - Initiate corrective action: recalibrate, repair, or adjust ESC temperature system as needed.\n\n   - **If ESC Heater Temp is NOT Out of Range:**  \n     - If ESC temperature is within spec and no correlation is found, continue investigating other potential root causes (e.g., RF, chamber pressure, ESC clamping).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Step | Action | Key Criteria |\n|------|--------|--------------|\n| 1 | Confirm SPC shift | LEVEL-SHIFT >2σ, >20 samples |\n| 2 | Review ESC temp logs | Out of range: ±0.5°C accuracy, ±1°C uniformity |\n| 3 | Correlate timing | Shift matches ESC temp deviation |\n| 4 | Check sensors & heater | Sensor agreement, no overshoot, correct ramp |\n| 5 | Check He cooling & power | He flow <2sccm, voltage stable |\n| 6 | Review calibration & PM | Calibration valid, surface OK |\n| 7 | Review recipe | Setpoints correct, no recent changes |\n| 8 | Rule out other causes | No other parameter shifts |\n| 9 | Decide & document | ESC temp out of range = root cause |\n\n---\n\n**Tip for Junior Engineers:**  \nAlways document your findings with screenshots, data logs, and a summary of your reasoning. If in doubt, consult with a senior engineer before taking corrective action.\n\n---\n\n**If you follow this process, you will be able to confidently determine whether ESC_heater_temp_out_of_range is the true root cause of the SPC systematic shift.**",
