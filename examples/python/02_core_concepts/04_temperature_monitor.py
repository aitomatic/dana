"""Temperature Monitoring Pipeline Example

This example demonstrates how to create and execute a simple data processing pipeline
in the DXA framework. The pipeline reads temperature data from a simulated sensor,
analyzes it, and reports the results. It also shows how the pipeline can be used
both as an execution graph and as a discoverable resource.

Key concepts:
- Pipeline creation and configuration
- Pipeline as both execution graph and resource
- Asynchronous data processing
- Step-by-step data transformation
- Pipeline execution and querying
