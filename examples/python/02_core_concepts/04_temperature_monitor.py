"""Temperature Monitoring Pipeline Example

This example demonstrates how to create and execute a simple data processing pipeline
in the DXA framework. The pipeline reads temperature data from a simulated sensor,
analyzes it, and reports the results.

Key concepts:
- Pipeline creation and configuration
- Asynchronous data processing
- Step-by-step data transformation
- Pipeline execution

Learning path: Core Concepts
Complexity: Intermediate

Prerequisites:
- None
