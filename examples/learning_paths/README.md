# DXA Learning Paths

This directory organizes DXA examples into structured learning paths to help you progress from beginner to advanced concepts. Each subdirectory represents a learning path with increasing complexity.

## Directory Structure

- **01_getting_started/**: Beginner-friendly examples to get started with DXA
- **02_core_concepts/**: Intermediate examples covering the core concepts of DXA
- **03_advanced_patterns/**: Advanced examples demonstrating sophisticated patterns
- **04_real_world_applications/**: Domain-specific examples showing real-world applications

## How to Use

Each learning path directory contains symbolic links to examples in the main examples directory. Follow these examples in sequence to build your understanding progressively.

For a more detailed guide on each learning path, refer to the corresponding index files:
- [Getting Started](../GETTING_STARTED.md)
- [Core Concepts](../CORE_CONCEPTS.md)
- [Advanced Patterns](../ADVANCED_PATTERNS.md)
- [Real-World Applications](../REAL_WORLD_APPLICATIONS.md)

## Note

The original examples remain in their module-based directories. This organization provides an alternative way to navigate the examples based on learning progression rather than module structure.
