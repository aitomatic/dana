# Core Concepts in DXA

This directory contains examples that demonstrate the core concepts of the DXA framework. Follow these examples in sequence to understand the three-layer execution model and key components.

## Examples in this Learning Path

1. [01_run_default_workflow.py](01_run_default_workflow.py): Running default workflows
   - Workflow execution process
   - Handling workflow results

2. [02_simple_plan.py](02_simple_plan.py): Basic planning patterns
   - Creating plans from objectives
   - Plan structure and components
   - Understanding the planning layer

3. [03_simple_reasoning.py](03_simple_reasoning.py): Basic reasoning patterns
   - Reasoning strategies
   - Executing reasoning tasks
   - Understanding the reasoning layer

4. [04_temperature_monitor.py](04_temperature_monitor.py): Data pipeline example
   - Processing streaming data
   - Continuous execution patterns
   - Sensor data analysis

5. [05_llm_resource.py](05_llm_resource.py): LLM integration
   - Configuring LLM resources
   - Using LLMs in agents
   - Managing LLM interactions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:
- Understand the three-layer execution model (Workflow, Planning, Reasoning)
- Work with different execution strategies
- Process data through pipelines
- Integrate and use resources

## Next Steps

After completing this learning path, proceed to the [Advanced Patterns](../03_advanced_patterns/) learning path to explore sophisticated workflow patterns and complex applications.
