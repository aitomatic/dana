## Key Observations

### Successful Patterns
1. **Resource Integration:** Dana successfully integrates various resources (RAG, web search, webpages)
2. **Type Flexibility:** Semantic type coercion works seamlessly across different data types
3. **Function Composition:** Pipelining and workflow capabilities are robust
4. **Real-time Data:** Successfully retrieves and processes current information from multiple sources

### Resource Types Demonstrated
- **RAG Resources:** Document querying and knowledge retrieval
- **Web Search:** Real-time information gathering
- **Webpage Scraping:** News and content analysis
- **MCP Integration:** Protocol-based service communication (when server available)
- **Mixed Resources:** Combination of multiple resource types

### Dana Language Features Showcased
- Built-in reasoning with `reason()` function
- Resource management with `use()` statements
- Context-aware programming
- Semantic type handling
- Function pipelining with `|` operator
- Agent-native programming patterns

## Technical Environment

- **Virtual Environment:** Successfully activated for all executions
- **Command Pattern:** `dana <filename>.na` for individual file execution
- **Resource Caching:** RAG resources used local caching (.cache directories)
- **Network Dependencies:** Web search and webpage resources require internet connectivity

## Recommendations

1. **MCP Server Reliability:** The MCP resource example shows that connection issues may be transient - retry mechanisms can be effective
2. **Resource Documentation:** Examples effectively demonstrate Dana's resource system capabilities
3. **Workshop Progression:** Examples progress logically from basic to advanced concepts
4. **Real-world Applications:** Examples show practical use cases for agentic AI development
5. **Complete Success:** All 9 examples now execute successfully, demonstrating Dana's robust resource integration
