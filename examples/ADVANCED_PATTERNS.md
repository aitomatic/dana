# Advanced Patterns in DXA

This guide provides a structured learning path for exploring advanced patterns in the DXA framework. These examples build on the Core Concepts path and demonstrate sophisticated workflow patterns and complex applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:
- Implement complex workflow patterns
- Create multi-step research workflows
- Build monitoring and health check systems
- Work with advanced resource configurations

## Examples in this Learning Path

### 1. ProSEA Framework

Start with this example to understand the Problem-Solution-Evaluation-Action pattern:

- [execution/workflow/prosea_workflow.py](execution/workflow/prosea_workflow.py): ProSEA framework implementation
  - Problem-Solution-Evaluation-Action pattern
  - Complex reasoning workflows
  - Structured problem-solving approach

### 2. Multi-Step Research

Next, explore multi-step research workflows:

- [execution/workflow/complex_research.py](execution/workflow/complex_research.py): Multi-step research pattern
  - Sequential task execution
  - Managing complex workflows
  - Research and analysis patterns

### 3. System Monitoring

Learn about system monitoring and health checks:

- [execution/workflow/system_health.py](execution/workflow/system_health.py): System monitoring example
  - Health check workflows
  - Monitoring and alerting patterns
  - System diagnostics

### 4. Advanced Resource Integration

Finally, explore advanced resource integration:

- [resource/mcp/mcp_agent_demo.py](resource/mcp/mcp_agent_demo.py): MCP integration
  - Using the Model Control Plane
  - Advanced resource configuration
  - Managing model deployments

## Suggested Learning Order

1. Start with [execution/workflow/prosea_workflow.py](execution/workflow/prosea_workflow.py) to understand the ProSEA pattern
2. Move to [execution/workflow/complex_research.py](execution/workflow/complex_research.py) to learn about multi-step research
3. Explore system monitoring with [execution/workflow/system_health.py](execution/workflow/system_health.py)
4. Understand advanced resource integration with [resource/mcp/mcp_agent_demo.py](resource/mcp/mcp_agent_demo.py)

## Key Concepts

### Complex Workflow Patterns

```python
from dxa.execution import WorkflowFactory

# Create a ProSEA workflow
workflow = WorkflowFactory.create_prosea_workflow(
    objective="Solve the climate change problem",
    agent_role="Environmental Scientist"
)
```

### Multi-Step Execution

```python
# Create a sequential workflow with multiple steps
workflow = WorkflowFactory.create_sequential_workflow(
    objective="Research AI safety",
    commands=[
        "Identify key AI safety organizations",
        "Analyze their research focus areas",
        "Compare approaches to value alignment",
        "Generate summary report"
    ]
)
```

### Continuous Monitoring

```python
import asyncio
from dxa.common.graph.traversal import ContinuousTraversal

# Create a continuous traversal strategy
strategy = ContinuousTraversal(interval_seconds=60)

# Execute continuously
async def monitor_system():
    while True:
        await agent.async_run(health_check_workflow, strategy=strategy)
        await asyncio.sleep(60)
```
