# Test Agent Log Demo
# This example demonstrates the new log() method and on_log() callback functionality

# Import the agent system
import agent

# Define a simple agent
agent TestLogger:
    name: str = "demo_agent"
    log_level: str = "INFO"

# Create an instance
logger_agent = TestLogger()

# Test the log() method
logger_agent.log("Hello from the agent!")

# Test with different messages
logger_agent.log("This is a test message")
logger_agent.log("Agent is working correctly")

# The log() method should output messages to the console
# and can be used for debugging and monitoring agent behavior
