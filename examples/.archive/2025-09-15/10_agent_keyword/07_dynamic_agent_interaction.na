🔗 How Dynamic Extraction Works (Etch RCA):

1. DEFECT ANALYST → PROCESS ENGINEER
   - RCA findings (e.g., micro-masking, plasma instability) drive process optimization
2. DEFECT ANALYST + PROCESS ENGINEER → EQUIPMENT SPECIALIST
   - Chamber/plasma issues and process needs drive equipment maintenance/upgrade
3. ALL AGENTS → COST ANALYST
   - Aggregated recommendations inform ROI and investment decisions

💡 Key Difference from Hardcoded Approach:
- Findings are extracted from actual agent responses
- Each agent builds on real insights, not predetermined values
- Dynamic adaptation based on actual etch process complexity
- More realistic and context-aware recommendations
