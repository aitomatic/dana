# ðŸŒ± Smart Greenhouse Demo

A visual demonstration of POET's learning capabilities applied to agriculture and greenhouse management.

## Overview

This demo showcases two greenhouse control systems side-by-side:

1. **Basic Greenhouse** (SENSE + ACT): Fixed schedules and thresholds
2. **POET Greenhouse** (SENSE + THINK + ACT): Adaptive learning control

Watch as POET learns to optimize plant growth, resource usage, and yield through real-time adaptation.

## Features
