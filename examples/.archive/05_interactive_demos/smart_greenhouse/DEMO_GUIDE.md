# 🌱 Smart Greenhouse Demo - Quick Start Guide

## What You'll See

A **side-by-side comparison** of two greenhouse systems:

### Left Side: Basic Greenhouse (SENSE + ACT)
- **Purple theme** 📅 Fixed schedules and thresholds
- Waters when soil moisture drops below 30%
- Lights on 6 AM - 6 PM, no adaptation
- Daily nutrient feeding at 8 AM
- No learning or optimization

### Right Side: POET Greenhouse (SENSE + THINK + ACT)  
- **Green theme** 🧠 Adaptive learning control
- **Same base logic** as basic system
- POET enhances with botanical optimization
- Learns optimal watering, lighting, and feeding patterns
- Interactive feedback buttons for human input

## Key Features to Watch

### 🌿 Plant Growth Visualization
- Plants start as seedlings 🌱
- Progress through: vegetative 🌿 → flowering 🌸 → fruiting 🍅
- Plant emojis change based on health and growth stage
- Visual health indicators (green=healthy, yellow=stressed, red=poor)

### 📊 Real-Time Charts
- **Plant Health**: POET maintains higher, more stable health scores
- **Plant Size**: POET-grown plants typically grow larger
- **Water Usage**: POET learns to use less water more efficiently
- **Cumulative Yield**: POET optimizes for better crop production

### 🤖 POET Learning Progress
- Watch the "POET Learning" panel (bottom right)
- Learning recommendations evolve over time:
  - Early: "Calibrating sensor baselines"
  - Mid: "Detecting optimal watering windows" 
  - Later: "Yield optimization active", "Water savings: 25%"
- Success rate improves from ~60% to 98%

### 🎮 Interactive Elements
- **Growth Feedback Buttons**: Click to tell POET how plants are doing
  - 🌟 Thriving → Reinforces current approach
  - 😊 Healthy → Minor positive feedback
  - 😰 Stressed → Triggers optimization adjustments
  - 🥀 Wilting → Major correction signal
- **Start/Reset**: Control the simulation

## Expected Learning Progression

### Phase 1 (First 10 cycles): Learning Basics
- POET: "Learning optimal growing conditions..."
- Similar performance to basic system
- Building baseline understanding

### Phase 2 (10-30 cycles): Pattern Recognition  
- POET: "Analyzing plant response patterns..."
- Beginning to show water usage improvements
- Slight health score advantages

### Phase 3 (30+ cycles): Optimization Active
- POET: "Yield optimization active"
- Clear advantages in all metrics:
  - 15-25% water savings
  - 10-20% yield improvement
  - More stable plant health
  - Lower stress levels

## Summary Comparison

After running for 20+ minutes, you should see:

| Metric | Basic Greenhouse | POET Greenhouse | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Avg Health | ~75% | ~85% | +13% |
| Water Usage | High | Reduced | -20% |
| Energy Usage | Standard | Optimized | -15% |
| Final Yield | Baseline | Enhanced | +18% |

## Key Learning Insights

1. **Same Logic + AI**: Both systems use identical base control logic - POET just adds intelligent optimization
2. **Continuous Improvement**: POET gets better over time, basic system stays static
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Better outcomes with less resource consumption
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Your feedback accelerates POET's learning
5. **Domain Expertise**: POET understands agriculture-specific constraints and objectives
