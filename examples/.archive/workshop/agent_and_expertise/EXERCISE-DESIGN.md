# Agent & Expertise: Hands-On Development Exercise Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for hands-on development exercises focused on building Domain-Expert Agents (DXAs) using Dana. These exercises are designed to teach participants how to create sophisticated AI agents that possess deep domain knowledge and can solve complex problems in specific fields.

## DXA Development Process Understanding

### What is a Domain-Expert Agent (DXA)?

A DXA is a specialized AI agent that combines:
- **Domain-specific expertise modules** containing specialized knowledge and capabilities
- **Intelligent reasoning** through LLM integration
- **Structured problem-solving** workflows
- **Resource integration** for working with external data and documents

### Core Development Components

#### 1. Agent Blueprint Definition
```dana
agent_blueprint CFA:
    expertise: list = [financial_analysis]
```
- Define the agent's identity and capabilities
- Specify which expertise modules the agent will use

#### 2. Expertise Module Architecture
- **Core Functions**: Domain-specific calculations and workflows
- **Data Types**: Structured representations for domain objects
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for data processing
- **LLM Integration**: Intelligent analysis and reasoning capabilities

#### 3. Modular Design Pattern
- **`__init__.na`**: Exports public functions via `__all__`
- **Specialized Modules**: Separate files for different domain aspects
- **Utils Package**: Shared utilities and data types

#### 4. Workflow Composition
- Functions composed using pipeline operator `|`
- Intermediate results passed between functions
- LLM functions provide intelligent analysis

#### 5. Resource Integration
