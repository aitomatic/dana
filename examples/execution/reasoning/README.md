# Reasoning Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating the Reasoning layer (HOW) of the DXA execution system. The Reasoning layer is responsible for the detailed implementation of individual tasks.

## Learning Paths

### Core Concepts [Intermediate]

These examples demonstrate key reasoning concepts:

- [simple_reasoning.py](simple_reasoning.py): Basic reasoning patterns
  - Reasoning strategies
  - Executing reasoning tasks
  - Understanding the reasoning layer

## Key Concepts

### Reasoning Creation

```python
from dxa.execution import ReasoningFactory
from dxa.execution.execution_types import Objective

# Create reasoning from an objective
objective = Objective("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
reasoning = ReasoningFactory.create_default_reasoning(objective)
```

### Reasoning Structure

A reasoning graph consists of:
- START node: Entry point for execution
- Task nodes: Detailed implementation steps
- END node: Exit point for execution

### Reasoning Strategies

```python
from dxa.execution import ReasoningStrategy

# Different reasoning strategies
default_reasoning = ReasoningFactory.create_reasoning(
    objective=objective,
    strategy=ReasoningStrategy.DEFAULT
)

chain_of_thought = ReasoningFactory.create_reasoning(
    objective=objective,
    strategy=ReasoningStrategy.CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT
)
```
