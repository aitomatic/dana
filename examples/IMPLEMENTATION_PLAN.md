# DXA Examples Reorganization Plan

This document outlines the steps needed to reorganize the DXA examples according to the new structure.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Documentation Updates

- [x] Update main README.md with new organization structure
- [x] Add learning path tags to each example file's docstring
- [x] Enhance individual example documentation with consistent format
- [x] Add cross-references between related examples

### 2. Directory Structure Updates

Current structure is organized by module type:
```
examples/
  basic/
  execution/
    workflow/
    planning/
    reasoning/
    pipeline/
  resource/
  fab-roca/
```

We'll maintain this structure but add README files in each directory to explain the learning path:

- [x] Add README.md to each subdirectory explaining its purpose and learning path
- [x] Create index files for each learning path that link to relevant examples

### 3. Example Enhancement

- [x] Review and enhance documentation for all existing examples
- [x] Ensure consistent documentation style across examples
- [x] Add complexity level tags to each example
- [x] Improve code comments for educational purposes

### 4. New Examples Development

- [ ] Prioritize development of new examples according to roadmap
- [ ] Start with high-priority examples
- [ ] Ensure new examples follow consistent documentation pattern
- [ ] Integrate new examples into the learning paths

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Documentation Reorganization (Completed)
- Update main README.md
- Add learning path tags to existing examples
- Create directory README files

### Phase 2: Example Enhancement (Completed)
- Review and enhance existing example documentation
- Improve code comments
- Add cross-references

### Phase 3: New Example Development (Next Steps)
- Develop high-priority new examples
- Integrate into learning paths
- Update documentation

## Guidelines for Example Documentation

Each example should include:

1. **Module Docstring**
   - Purpose and overview
   - Key concepts demonstrated
   - Learning path and complexity level
   - Prerequisites (if any)

2. **Function/Class Docstrings**
   - Purpose
   - Parameters
   - Return values
   - Examples (where appropriate)

3. **Code Comments**
   - Explanation of complex logic
   - Educational notes
   - Implementation details

4. **Cross-References**
   - Related examples
   - Next steps in learning path
   - Relevant documentation
