# DXA Examples Directory Reorganization

This document summarizes the reorganization of the DXA examples directory structure.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Learning Path-Based Organization

Added a new directory structure that organizes examples by learning path:

```
/examples/learning_paths/
  /01_getting_started/       # Beginner-friendly examples
  /02_core_concepts/         # Intermediate examples
  /03_advanced_patterns/     # Advanced examples
  /04_real_world_applications/ # Domain-specific examples
```

Each learning path directory contains symbolic links to the actual examples, organized in a logical progression. This allows users to follow a structured learning path while maintaining the original module-based organization.

### 2. End-to-End Tutorials

Added a new directory for step-by-step tutorials:

```
/examples/tutorials/
  /build_qa_agent/           # Tutorial for building a QA agent
  /temperature_monitoring/   # Tutorial for building a monitoring system
```

Each tutorial is organized as a series of numbered Python files that guide users through building a complete application.

### 3. Documentation Updates

Updated documentation to reflect the new organization:

- Added README files for each learning path directory
- Added README files for each tutorial
- Updated the main README to reference the new organization

## Benefits of the Reorganization

1. **Multiple Navigation Paths**: Users can navigate examples by module type (original structure) or by learning path (new structure).

2. **Structured Learning**: The learning path organization provides a clear progression from beginner to advanced concepts.

3. **End-to-End Tutorials**: The tutorials directory provides complete, step-by-step guides for building specific applications.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: The original module-based organization is preserved, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Tutorials**: Implement the remaining steps for each tutorial.

2. **Add New Examples**: Implement the examples outlined in the [Example Roadmap](EXAMPLE_ROADMAP.md).

3. **Enhance Documentation**: Continue to improve documentation with more code snippets, diagrams, and cross-references.

4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on the new organization and make adjustments as needed.
