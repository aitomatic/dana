# üè† Smart HVAC Demo

This demo showcases the power of POET (Perceive ‚Üí Operate ‚Üí Enforce ‚Üí Train) by comparing two HVAC control systems side-by-side:

- **Left Side (Basic HVAC)**: Traditional SENSE + ACT approach
- **Right Side (POET HVAC)**: Enhanced SENSE + THINK + ACT approach

## Key Demonstrations

### Basic HVAC System
- **Manual Control**: User must manually adjust thermostat target temperature
- **Simple Logic**: Basic proportional control (same code as POET system)
- **No Learning**: Static parameters, no optimization
- **User Burden**: Requires constant manual adjustments

### POET HVAC System  
- **Comfort-Based Control**: User just clicks "Too Hot" / "Too Cold" / "Comfortable"
- **Same Logic**: Identical control algorithm, enhanced by POET
- **Automatic Learning**: Learns optimal setpoints from user feedback
- **Intelligence Added**: Domain expertise, energy optimization, equipment protection

## Expected Results

The demo shows that POET achieves:
- **Higher Comfort Score**: Better temperature control with fewer oscillations
- **Lower Energy Consumption**: Intelligent optimization reduces waste
- **Less User Effort**: Comfort feedback vs manual thermostat adjustments

## Architecture

```
Basic HVAC: User Input ‚Üí Simple Control Logic ‚Üí HVAC Output
POET HVAC:  User Feedback ‚Üí POET Enhancement ‚Üí Simple Control Logic ‚Üí HVAC Output
```

The key insight: **The business logic is identical**. POET adds the intelligence through:
- **P**: Input optimization (setpoint adjustment)
- **O**: Reliable execution (retries, error handling)
- **E**: Output validation (equipment protection, safety)
- **T**: Learning optimization (comfort patterns, energy efficiency)

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Startup

## Expected Demonstration Results

After 20-30 minutes of simulation:

| Metric | Basic HVAC | POET HVAC | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Avg Comfort Score | 75-85 | 85-95 | +10-15% |
| Energy Consumption | Baseline | 15-25% less | 15-25% savings |
| User Adjustments | 8-12 manual | 3-5 feedback | 60% reduction |
| Temperature Stability | ¬±2¬∞F swings | ¬±1¬∞F swings | 50% better |

## Code Insights

The demo shows that both systems use **identical control logic**:

```python
# Both systems use this same function
def hvac_control(current_temp, target_temp, outdoor_temp, occupancy):
    temp_error = target_temp - current_temp
    
    if abs(temp_error) < 0.5:
        return HVACCommand(0, 0, 20, "idle")
    elif temp_error > 0:
        output = min(100, abs(temp_error) * 20)
        return HVACCommand(output, 0, output+20, "heating")
    else:
        output = min(100, abs(temp_error) * 20)
        return HVACCommand(0, output, output+20, "cooling")
```

**The only difference**: The POET version has `@poet(domain="building_management")` decorator!

This demonstrates POET's core value: **Transform simple business logic into enterprise-grade systems with a single line of code.**

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure port 8000 is available
- Verify CORS settings if accessing from different domain

### POET Import Errors
- Ensure PYTHONPATH includes dana project
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify Python version compatibility (3.9+)

### Simulation Performance
- Reduce update frequency if CPU usage is high
- Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
- Ensure adequate system memory for real-time updates
