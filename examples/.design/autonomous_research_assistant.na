Autonomous Research Assistant with CORRAL Knowledge Lifecycle Demo

This demo showcases Dana's complete agentic AI knowledge lifecycle through an
intelligent research assistant that autonomously conducts comprehensive research
across multiple domains. It demonstrates:

1. CORRAL Agentic Knowledge Lifecycle: Curate → Organize → Retrieve → Reason → Act → Learn
2. Cross-domain knowledge synthesis and pattern recognition
3. Agent memory accumulation and research expertise building
4. Type-aware reasoning for different research deliverable formats
5. Autonomous knowledge curation and organization
6. Research methodology learning and improvement over time

CORRAL Phases Demonstrated:
- CURATE: Automatic source gathering and knowledge extraction
- ORGANIZE: Intelligent categorization and structure of research findings
- RETRIEVE: Context-aware information assembly for specific queries
- REASON: Intelligent analysis and insight synthesis
- ACT: Generation of research deliverables and reports
- LEARN: Methodology improvement and pattern recognition

Key Innovation:
- Research agent becomes more effective with each research project
- Cross-domain insight synthesis from accumulated knowledge
- Automatic research methodology optimization
- Domain expertise accumulation without manual knowledge base maintenance

Business Value:
- Transforms weeks of research into hours with AI acceleration
- Cross-domain insight discovery through intelligent synthesis
- Research quality improvement through learning and pattern recognition
- Scalable research capability across multiple domains simultaneously

Dana Features Demonstrated:
- Native `agent` keyword with research domain intelligence
- Built-in `plan()`, `solve()`, and `reason()` with research expertise
- Agent memory for accumulated research patterns and methodologies
- POET-enhanced workflows for research pipeline reliability
- Type-aware reasoning for different research output formats
- Struct methods for clean research data modeling
