# Agent, Resource, Workflow â€“ user-level scenarios (design-first)
# This file demonstrates desired Dana syntax/behavior for:
# 1) agent singletons with built-in conversational memory across TUI sessions
# 2) resource declaration/usage patterns
# 3) workflow declaration/usage patterns

# --- Session 1 (Dana TUI) ----------------------------------------------------
# In a fresh TUI session, the user types the following lines interactively.

agent Neo

print(Neo.chat("Hi! My name is Christopher."))
print(Neo.chat("I specialize in neurosymbolic AI."))


# End Session 1 (user exits the TUI)


# --- Session 2 (Dana TUI, new process) --------------------------------------
# In a new TUI session, the user again types the following.

agent Neo

# enhanced reasoning: with context from `resource_weather_info`,
