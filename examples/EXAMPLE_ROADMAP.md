# DXA Examples Roadmap

This document outlines proposed new examples to enhance the DXA framework documentation.

## Proposed New Examples

### Getting Started (Beginner Level)

1. **Hello World Agent** (`basic/hello_world.py`)
   - The simplest possible agent implementation
   - Basic agent creation and execution

2. **Agent Configuration Patterns** (`basic/agent_configuration.py`)
   - Different ways to configure an agent
   - Setting up capabilities and resources

### Core Concepts (Intermediate Level)

3. **Signal Handling** (`execution/signal_handling.py`)
   - Working with execution signals
   - Signal-based communication between components

4. **Conditional Workflows** (`execution/workflow/conditional_workflow.py`)
   - Creating workflows with branching logic
   - Implementing decision nodes

5. **Parallel Execution** (`execution/workflow/parallel_workflow.py`)
   - Concurrent task execution
   - Managing parallel workflow branches

6. **Error Handling Patterns** (`execution/error_handling.py`)
   - Handling errors and exceptions in workflows
   - Recovery strategies

### Integration Examples (Intermediate to Advanced)

7. **External API Integration** (`integration/api_integration.py`)
   - Connecting to external services
   - Processing API responses

8. **Database Integration** (`integration/database_integration.py`)
   - Working with databases
   - Data-driven workflows

### Advanced Use Cases (Advanced Level)

9. **Conversational Agent** (`advanced/conversational_agent.py`)
   - Building a multi-turn conversation agent
   - Managing conversation state

10. **Document Analysis Pipeline** (`advanced/document_analysis.py`)
    - Processing and analyzing documents
    - Multi-stage document processing

### Testing & Debugging (All Levels)

11. **Testing Workflows** (`testing/workflow_testing.py`)
    - How to test DXA workflows
    - Unit testing execution components

12. **Debugging Execution** (`testing/debugging_execution.py`)
    - Techniques for debugging execution issues
    - Logging and tracing

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Address immediate needs)
   - Hello World Agent
   - Conditional Workflows
   - Error Handling Patterns
   - Testing Workflows

2. **Medium Priority** (Enhance understanding)
   - Signal Handling
   - External API Integration
   - Debugging Execution

3. **Lower Priority** (Complete the ecosystem)
   - Advanced Use Cases
   - Database Integration
