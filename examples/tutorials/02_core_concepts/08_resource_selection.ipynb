    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore how OpenDXA agents can intelligently select and use different resources based on task requirements. Resource selection is a crucial capability for building versatile agents that can handle a variety of tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to create custom resources, integrate Model Control Protocol (MCP) services, and use specialized agents as resources. We'll demonstrate how an agent automatically selects the most appropriate resource for each specific task, leading to more effective problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. Create custom resources by extending BaseResource\n",
    "2. Use MCP (Model Control Protocol) resources\n",
    "3. Create specialized agents as resources\n",
    "4. Understand how agents select resources based on task requirements\n",
    "5. Combine multiple resources in a single agent\n",

    "## Conceptual Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources in OpenDXA provide agents with capabilities to access external services, data sources, or specialized functionalities. They act as interfaces between the agent and various tools or services it might need to accomplish its tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource selection is the process by which an agent determines which resource is most appropriate for a given task. This selection happens automatically based on the resource descriptions and the nature of the task. Effective resource selection allows agents to be more versatile and efficient, leveraging specialized tools when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OpenDXA architecture, resources are abstracted behind consistent interfaces, allowing agents to interact with them in a uniform way regardless of their underlying implementation. This abstraction enables the creation of modular, extensible agent systems."

Workflow Objective: Best Places to Visit in San Francisco\\\\n\\\\nThis overarching objective focuses on identifying the most notable and appealing locations for visitors in San Francisco. The significance of this objective lies in the fact that San Francisco is a prominent tourist destination known for its unique culture, landmarks, and attractions. To achieve this objective, we must consider factors such as popularity, cultural significance, historical interest, and accessibility.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Workflow Node Within Workflow: Query in Best Places to Visit in San Francisco\\\\n\\\\nThis node suggests a more specific action: querying or gathering information about the best places to visit in San Francisco. The query must be designed to extract relevant data that aligns with our overarching objective. It may involve utilizing various sources such as travel guides, online platforms, local recommendations, and expert opinions. The query should target a range of aspects, including:\\\\n\\\\n- Historical landmarks (e.g., Alcatraz Island, Golden Gate Bridge)\\\\n- Cultural institutions (e.g., museums, galleries)\\\\n- Natural attractions (e.g., parks, coastal areas)\\\\n- Entertainment venues (e.g., theaters, music venues)\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Plan Node Under Workflow Node Objective: Query in Best Places to Visit in San Francisco\\\\n\\\\nIn this plan node, we outline a strategy for conducting the query effectively. The approach should be systematic and could include the following steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Define Criteria for “Best”**: Establish what constitutes the \"best\" places—this could include visitor ratings, uniqueness, cultural value, and recommendations from locals.\\\\n   \\\\n2. **Identify Sources**: Determine where to gather information. This could include:\\\\n   - Travel websites (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp)\\\\n   - Local tourism boards\\\\n   - Blogs or articles written by travel enthusiasts\\\\n   - Social media platforms for real-time recommendations\\\\n\\\\n3. **Compile Data**: Extract and compile information from identified sources, ensuring a diverse range of perspectives and types of attractions.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Analyze and Rank**: Evaluate the compiled data to identify the most frequently mentioned and highly rated places. This may involve creating a scoring system based on visitor reviews or expert commentary.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Present Findings**: Organize the findings into a coherent list or guide that can easily inform potential visitors about the best places to visit.\\\\n\\\\n### 4. Reasoning Node Under Plan Node Objective: Query in Best Places to Visit in San Francisco\\\\n\\\\nIn this reasoning node, we delve deeper into the rationale behind each step of the plan:\\\\n\\\\n- **Defining Criteria**: This is crucial because the concept of \"best\" can vary widely among different visitors. By establishing objective criteria, we ensure that the query results are relevant to a broad audience.\\\\n\\\\n- **Identifying Sources**: The credibility and diversity of sources impact the quality of the information. Using multiple sources helps mitigate bias and provides a well-rounded view of attractions.\\\\n\\\\n- **Compiling Data**: This step is essential for synthesizing a wealth of information into a manageable format. It involves not just gathering data but also being discerning about what to include based on the established criteria.\\\\n\\\\n- **Analyzing and Ranking**: This is where we translate raw data into actionable insights. By analyzing trends in the data, we can make informed decisions about which places to highlight and why.\\\\n\\\\n- **Presenting Findings**: The final step ensures that the information is not only accurate but also accessible and engaging for the intended audience. Presentation matters in influencing travelers\\\\\\' choices.\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nThe objective hierarchy effectively guides the reasoning process for identifying the best places to visit in San Francisco. By systematically querying, compiling, analyzing, and presenting data, we ensure that the final output meets the needs of potential visitors seeking a curated experience in this iconic city. Each level of the hierarchy plays a critical role in achieving the overarching goal, creating a structured approach to travel recommendations.\\', error=None)\\nTool: weather__query__get-forecast\\nResponse: ResourceResponse(success=True, content=CallToolResult(meta=None, content=[TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'Forecast for 37.7749, -122.4194:\\\\n\\\\nThis Afternoon:\\\\nTemperature: 67°F\\\\nWind: 7 mph W\\\\nSunny\\\\n---\\\\nTonight:\\\\nTemperature: 53°F\\\\nWind: 7 mph SW\\\\nSlight Chance Light Rain\\\\n---\\\\nMonday:\\\\nTemperature: 64°F\\\\nWind: 5 to 8 mph WSW\\\\nSlight Chance Light Rain then Mostly Cloudy\\\\n---\\\\nMonday Night:\\\\nTemperature: 50°F\\\\nWind: 3 to 8 mph W\\\\nMostly Cloudy\\\\n---\\\\nTuesday:\\\\nTemperature: 65°F\\\\nWind: 3 to 10 mph W\\\\nSunny\\\\n---\\\\nTuesday Night:\\\\nTemperature: 50°F\\\\nWind: 3 to 10 mph WNW\\\\nMostly Clear\\\\n---\\\\nWednesday:\\\\nTemperature: 71°F\\\\nWind: 2 to 10 mph NW\\\\nSunny\\\\n---\\\\nWednesday Night:\\\\nTemperature: 52°F\\\\nWind: 2 to 10 mph W\\\\nPartly Cloudy\\\\n---\\\\nThursday:\\\\nTemperature: 69°F\\\\nWind: 2 to 10 mph W\\\\nMostly Sunny\\\\n---\\\\nThursday Night:\\\\nTemperature: 54°F\\\\nWind: 5 to 10 mph WNW\\\\nPartly Cloudy\\\\n---\\\\nFriday:\\\\nTemperature: 67°F\\\\nWind: 5 to 14 mph W\\\\nMostly Sunny\\\\n---\\\\nFriday Night:\\\\nTemperature: 50°F\\\\nWind: 8 to 14 mph WNW\\\\nMostly Clear\\\\n---\\\\nSaturday:\\\\nTemperature: 64°F\\\\nWind: 8 to 15 mph WNW\\\\nSunny\\\\n---\\\\nSaturday Night:\\\\nTemperature: 48°F\\\\nWind: 7 to 15 mph WNW\\\\nMostly Clear\\\\n---\\', annotations=None)], isError=False), error=None)\\nTool: restaurant_options__query\\nResponse: ResourceResponse(success=True, content={\\'restaurants\\': [{\\'name\\': \\'Park Bistro\\', \\'cuisine\\': \\'American\\', \\'rating\\': 4.5, \\'price\\': \\'$$\\', \\'location\\': \\'123 Park St\\', \\'available_times\\': [\\'1:00 PM\\', \\'2:00 PM\\', \\'3:00 PM\\']}, {\\'name\\': \\'Garden Cafe\\', \\'cuisine\\': \\'Farm-to-table\\', \\'rating\\': 4.7, \\'price\\': \\'$$$\\', \\'location\\': \\'456 Garden Ave\\', \\'available_times\\': [\\'2:30 PM\\', \\'3:30 PM\\']}]}, error=None)\\n</tool_calling>'}]\n",
