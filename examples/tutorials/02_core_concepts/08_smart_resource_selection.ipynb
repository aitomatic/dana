    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll explore how OpenDXA agents can intelligently select and use different resources based on task requirements. Resource selection is a crucial capability for building versatile agents that can handle a variety of tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to create custom resources, integrate Model Control Protocol (MCP) services, and use specialized agents as resources. We'll demonstrate how an agent automatically selects the most appropriate resource for each specific task, leading to more effective problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. Create custom resources by extending BaseResource\n",
    "2. Use MCP (Model Control Protocol) resources\n",
    "3. Create specialized agents as resources\n",
    "4. Understand how agents select resources based on task requirements\n",
    "5. Combine multiple resources in a single agent\n",

    "## Conceptual Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources in OpenDXA provide agents with capabilities to access external services, data sources, or specialized functionalities. They act as interfaces between the agent and various tools or services it might need to accomplish its tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource selection is the process by which an agent determines which resource is most appropriate for a given task. This selection happens automatically based on the resource descriptions and the nature of the task. Effective resource selection allows agents to be more versatile and efficient, leveraging specialized tools when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the OpenDXA architecture, resources are abstracted behind consistent interfaces, allowing agents to interact with them in a uniform way regardless of their underlying implementation. This abstraction enables the creation of modular, extensible agent systems."

    "In this tutorial, you've learned how to create and combine different types of resources in an OpenDXA agent. We covered creating custom resources, integrating MCP services, and using specialized agents as resources. You've seen how the agent intelligently selects the appropriate resource for each task based on the resource descriptions and task requirements.\n",

    "In the next tutorial, \"Advanced Agent Orchestration\", you'll learn how to coordinate multiple agents working together on complex tasks, taking resource selection to the next level with sophisticated workflow patterns."
