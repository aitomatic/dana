# Building a Temperature Monitoring System

This tutorial guides you through building a complete temperature monitoring system using the DXA framework. Follow the steps in sequence to create a data pipeline that processes sensor data, analyzes temperature patterns, and generates alerts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Create data processing pipelines
- Implement continuous execution patterns
- Process streaming sensor data
- Build monitoring and alerting systems
