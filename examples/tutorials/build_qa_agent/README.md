# Building a Question-Answering Agent

This tutorial guides you through building a complete question-answering agent using the DXA framework. Follow the steps in sequence to create a fully functional agent that can answer questions using different approaches.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Create and configure a DXA agent
- Implement different question-answering approaches
- Understand the execution flow for QA tasks
- Deploy a functional QA agent

## Tutorial Steps

1. [01_agent_setup.py](01_agent_setup.py): Setting up the agent
   - Creating a basic agent
   - Configuring logging
   - Adding LLM resources

2. [02_workflow_creation.py](02_workflow_creation.py): Creating a workflow
   - Designing a QA workflow
   - Adding nodes and edges
   - Configuring execution strategies

3. [03_resource_integration.py](03_resource_integration.py): Adding resources
   - Integrating LLM resources
   - Configuring resource parameters
   - Managing resource interactions

4. [04_running_agent.py](04_running_agent.py): Running the agent
   - Executing the workflow
   - Processing results
   - Handling errors and edge cases

## Prerequisites

- DXA framework installed
- Access to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
