# Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added "workflow" as a built-in struct keyword to the Dana language, similar to "agent_blueprint" and "resource".

## Changes Made

### 1. Grammar Updates (`dana/core/lang/parser/dana_grammar.lark`)

- **Added WORKFLOW keyword**: `WORKFLOW.2: "workflow"`
- **Updated definition rule**: Added `WORKFLOW` to the definition rule alongside `STRUCT`, `RESOURCE`, and `AGENT_BLUEPRINT`
- **Updated NAME token exclusion**: Added "workflow" to the list of excluded keywords in the NAME token regex

### 2. AST Definition (`dana/core/lang/ast/__init__.py`)

- **Added WorkflowDefinition class**: Created a new AST node class for workflow definitions
- **Structure**: Similar to ResourceDefinition with fields, methods, docstring, and location
- **Usage**: `workflow MyWorkflow: fields...`

### 3. Parser Transformer (`dana/core/lang/parser/transformer/statement/function_definition_transformer.py`)

- **Added WorkflowDefinition import**: Imported the new AST class
- **Added workflow handling**: Added `elif keyword_token.value == "workflow"` case to return `WorkflowDefinition`

### 4. Statement Executor (`dana/core/lang/interpreter/executor/statement_executor.py`)

- **Added WorkflowDefinition import**: Imported the new AST class
- **Added workflow handler**: Added `WorkflowDefinition: self.execute_workflow_definition` to the handlers dictionary
- **Added execute_workflow_definition method**: Implemented workflow definition execution similar to resource definitions

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Definition Syntax
```dana
workflow MyWorkflow:
    steps: list[str] = ["step1", "step2"]
    name: str = "test_workflow"
    is_active: bool = true
```

### Workflow Instantiation
```dana
my_workflow = MyWorkflow(steps=["custom_step1", "custom_step2"])
```

### Field Access
```dana
print(my_workflow.name)      # "test_workflow"
print(my_workflow.steps)     # ["custom_step1", "custom_step2"]
print(my_workflow.is_active) # true
```

## Behavior

Workflows behave similarly to resources and structs:
- **Constructor pattern**: `workflow` creates a constructor function that returns instances
- **Type registration**: Workflow types are registered in the TYPE_REGISTRY
- **Field support**: Full support for typed fields with default values
- **Method support**: Can include methods via struct-function pattern
- **Inheritance**: Can inherit from other workflow types

## Testing

- ✅ Grammar syntax validation passed
- ✅ AST class definition confirmed
- ✅ Transformer integration confirmed
- ✅ Statement executor integration confirmed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```dana
workflow DataProcessing:
    input_files: list[str] = []
    output_format: str = "json"
    batch_size: int = 1000
```

### Workflow with Methods
```dana
workflow AnalysisWorkflow:
    data_source: str = "database"
    analysis_type: str = "statistical"
    
def (self: AnalysisWorkflow) run_analysis():
    return f"Running {self.analysis_type} analysis on {self.data_source}"
```

### Workflow Inheritance
```dana
workflow BaseWorkflow:
    name: str = "base"
    version: str = "1.0"

workflow CustomWorkflow(BaseWorkflow):
    custom_field: str = "custom"
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

The workflow implementation integrates seamlessly with Dana's existing type system:
- **Struct system**: Workflows are treated as specialized structs
- **Type registry**: Workflow types are registered and managed like other types
- **Context system**: Workflow constructors are bound in the execution context
- **Error handling**: Proper error messages for workflow-related issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Workflow-specific lifecycle methods (start, stop, pause, resume)
- Workflow execution state tracking
- Workflow composition and chaining
- Workflow-specific validation rules
- Integration with Dana's agent system for intelligent workflow execution
