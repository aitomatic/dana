# GitHub Action to run Ruff code analysis and formatting
# - Runs on Python 3.12 
# - Uses Ruff for fast linting and formatting checks (non-blocking during development)
# - Follows OpenDXA coding standards from pyproject.toml
# - Reports issues but doesn't fail CI to maintain development velocity
# This provides fast feedback while allowing iterative code improvement
