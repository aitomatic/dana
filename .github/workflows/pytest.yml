# GitHub Action to run pytest on pull requests
# - Runs on Python 3.12
# - Installs the package and its dependencies
# - Executes fast regression tests only (excludes deep/comprehensive tests)
# - For full test coverage, run locally with: uv run pytest -m "not live" tests/
# This helps catch regressions quickly while keeping CI times reasonable
