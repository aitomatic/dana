# GitHub Action to run pytest sequentially (for comprehensive weekly testing)
# - Runs weekly and on manual trigger only
# - Primary testing is handled by pytest-parallel.yml (faster)
# - Provides thorough sequential testing for edge case detection
# - Tests struct implementation comprehensively with mock LLM
# - For regular CI/CD, use pytest-parallel.yml instead
# - For full test coverage, run locally with: uv run pytest -m "not live" tests/
# This provides comprehensive testing without slowing down regular development
