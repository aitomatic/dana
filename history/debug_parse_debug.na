# Chain of Thought: Parse Debug Analysis
print("=== Parse Debug Analysis ===")

# Step 1: Analyze the specific error
error_analysis = reason("The error 'Unexpected token result1 at line 8, column 1. Expected _NL or $END' suggests the parser successfully parsed something before line 8, but then encountered 'result1' when it expected either a newline or end-of-file. What could cause this specific pattern?")
print("Error Analysis:")
print(error_analysis)
print("")

# Step 2: Compare working vs failing cases
comparison = reason(f"I have two cases: WORKING: A file with 'result1 = 5 | add_ten | double' that executes successfully. FAILING: Another file with the same line that gives 'Unexpected token result1 at line 8'. The error analysis shows: {error_analysis}. What could cause identical syntax to work in one file but fail in another?")
print("Working vs Failing Comparison:")
print(comparison)
print("")

# Step 3: Investigate line-by-line parsing
line_analysis = reason(f"Given this comparison: {comparison}, the error occurs at 'line 8, column 1' which suggests the parser processed lines 1-7 successfully but failed at line 8. What parsing state could cause the parser to expect end-of-file or newline instead of a new statement at line 8?")
print("Line-by-Line Analysis:")
print(line_analysis)
print("")

# Step 4: Propose debugging steps
debug_steps = reason(f"Based on this analysis: {line_analysis}, what specific debugging steps should I take to identify why the parser expects end-of-file at line 8? Consider: file encoding, whitespace, previous statement completion, or grammar state issues.")
