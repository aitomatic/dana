The error 'Expected $END or _NL' after 'result1' suggests the parser successfully parsed 'result1' as a token but then expected either end-of-file or newline. What does this tell us about how the assignment rule is structured in the Dana grammar?")

# Step 3: Analyze the missing functions issue (chaining from previous analysis)
function_analysis = reason(f"Based on the issues identified: {issue_identification}, the errors 'Function str not found' and 'Error accessing variable local.print' suggest built-in functions aren't properly registered. Given the Dana architecture with function registries and core function registration, what could cause built-in functions to be missing?")
