# Chain of Thought: Context Analysis
print("=== Context Analysis ===")

# Step 1: Analyze the pattern discovery
pattern_discovery = reason("I discovered that 'result1 = 5 | add_ten | double' fails at whatever line it appears on (line 8, then line 9 when moved), but the SAME syntax works in other files. The error is always 'Expected _NL or $END' before the assignment. What does this suggest about the parsing context?")
print("Pattern Discovery:")
print(pattern_discovery)
print("")

# Step 2: Compare working vs failing contexts
context_comparison = reason(f"WORKING contexts: Files where the assignment works have print statements and function calls before the assignment. FAILING contexts: Files where it fails have only function definitions and comments before the assignment. Based on this pattern: {pattern_discovery}, what parsing state difference could cause this?")
print("Context Comparison:")
print(context_comparison)
print("")

# Step 3: Investigate parser state theory
parser_state = reason(f"Given this context analysis: {context_comparison}, could the Dana parser be in a different state after function definitions vs after executed statements? What parser state would expect 'end-of-file' instead of allowing new statements?")
print("Parser State Theory:")
print(parser_state)
print("")

# Step 4: Test the hypothesis
hypothesis = reason(f"Based on this parser state theory: {parser_state}, my hypothesis is that the parser needs some kind of 'activation' or 'execution context' before it can handle pipe assignments. What simple test could I run to verify this hypothesis?")
print("Hypothesis:")
print(hypothesis)
