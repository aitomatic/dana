# Chain of Thought: Solution Analysis
print("=== Solution Analysis ===")

# Step 1: Document the discovery
discovery = reason("I discovered that the parsing error 'Expected _NL or $END' was caused by missing newlines after function definitions. Adding explicit blank lines after function definitions allows subsequent statements to parse correctly. What does this tell us about the Dana grammar requirements?")

# Step 2: Analyze the grammar implications
grammar_analysis = reason(f"Based on this discovery: {discovery}, the Dana grammar rule 'statement: compound_stmt | simple_stmt _NL _NL*' requires that every statement end with a newline. Function definitions are compound statements, so they need proper newline termination before the parser can accept new statements. What are the implications for Dana code formatting?")

# Step 3: Provide best practices
best_practices = reason(f"Given this grammar requirement: {grammar_analysis}, what are the best practices Dana developers should follow when writing code with function definitions followed by executable statements?")
