# Chain of Thought: File Discrepancy Analysis
print("=== File Discrepancy Analysis ===")

# Step 1: Analyze the working vs failing pattern
pattern_analysis = reason("I have discovered that the line 'result1 = 5 | add_ten | double' works perfectly in one Dana file but fails with 'Unexpected token result1 at line 8' in another file. Both files have identical function definitions and the same line content. What could cause identical syntax to parse successfully in one file but fail in another?")
print("Pattern Analysis:")
print(pattern_analysis)
print("")

# Step 2: Investigate file-specific factors
file_factors = reason(f"Given this pattern: {pattern_analysis}, what file-specific factors could cause parsing differences? Consider: 1) File creation method differences, 2) Hidden characters or encoding, 3) Line ending variations, 4) Parser state differences, 5) Context-dependent grammar rules.")
print("File-Specific Factors:")
print(file_factors)
print("")

# Step 3: Focus on the str() function issue
str_issue = reason(f"The original failing file also had 'str(result1)' which caused 'Function str not found'. The working files use separate print statements instead of string concatenation with str(). Could the str() function issue be related to the parsing failure? Analysis: {file_factors}")
print("String Function Issue:")
print(str_issue)
print("")

# Step 4: Propose targeted solution
solution = reason(f"Based on this analysis: PATTERN: {pattern_analysis}, FACTORS: {file_factors}, STR ISSUE: {str_issue}, what is the most likely root cause and how should I fix the original file to make it work?")
print("Proposed Solution:")
print(solution)
