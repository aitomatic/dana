# Team Migration Strategy: OpenDXA â†’ Dana

> **ðŸ“‹ Complete Migration Documentation**: See `tmp/DANA_MIGRATION.md` and `tmp/MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for full technical details

## Current Situation Analysis

**Active Branches (Recent Activity):**
- `origin/feat/agent-keyword` - Lam Nguyen (2025-07-03) 
- `origin/feat/knows-team` - Christopher Nguyen (2025-07-03)
- `origin/feat/poet` - Christopher Nguyen (2025-07-02)
- `origin/feat/Prosea` - Lam Nguyen (2025-07-01)
- Multiple other feature branches with recent activity

**Migration Status:** 8/10 phases complete (80% done)

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Communication & Planning (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Team Communication
- [ ] **Announce migration** to all team members
- [ ] **Freeze new feature branches** using old import paths
- [ ] **Share this migration strategy** with team
- [ ] **Set migration deadline** (recommend: 1 week from today)

#### 1.2 Branch Assessment
- [ ] **Identify high-priority branches** that need immediate attention
- [ ] **Categorize branches** by migration effort required
- [ ] **Create migration timeline** for each active branch

### Phase 2: Compatibility Layer Extension (Today)

#### 2.1 Enhanced Backwards Compatibility
- [x] **Maintain full backwards compatibility** (already implemented)
- [ ] **Add branch-specific compatibility** if needed
- [ ] **Create migration verification script** for team members

#### 2.2 Migration Tools
- [ ] **Create branch migration script** (`scripts/migration/migrate_branch.py`)
- [ ] **Create import path converter** (`scripts/migration/convert_imports.py`)
- [ ] **Create validation script** (`scripts/migration/validate_branch.py`)

### Phase 3: Gradual Branch Migration (Next 1-2 weeks)

#### 3.1 Migration Priority Order
1. **High Priority (Migrate First):**
   - `feat/knows-team` (Christopher, very recent)
   - `feat/agent-keyword` (Lam, very recent)
   - `feat/poet` (Christopher, recent)

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - `feat/Prosea` (Lam, recent)
   - Demo branches with ongoing work

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Older feature branches
   - Experimental branches

#### 3.2 Migration Process Per Branch
For each branch, team members should:
1. **Create backup branch**: `git checkout -b backup-<branch-name>`
2. **Run migration script**: `python scripts/migration/migrate_branch.py`
3. **Test thoroughly**: Run existing tests + new validation
4. **Update imports gradually**: Use automated conversion tools
5. **Verify compatibility**: Ensure old imports still work

### Phase 4: Team Member Guidelines

#### 4.1 For Active Development
**Continue working normally** - the compatibility layer ensures all existing code works:
```python
# Old imports continue to work
from opendxa.dana.poet import poet
from opendxa.knows.core import KnowledgeBase
from opendxa.agent.agent import Agent

# New imports are preferred for new code
from dana.frameworks.poet import poet
from dana.frameworks.knows.core import KnowledgeBase  
from dana.frameworks.agent.agent import Agent
```

#### 4.2 For New Feature Branches
**Use new import paths** for all new branches:
```bash
# Good: Create new branches with new imports
git checkout -b feat/new-feature
# Use dana.* imports throughout
```

#### 4.3 For Existing Branches
**Two options:**
1. **Keep old imports** (automatic compatibility)
2. **Migrate to new imports** (using provided tools)

### Phase 5: Automated Migration Tools

#### 5.1 Branch Migration Script
```bash
# Migrate entire branch automatically
python scripts/migration/migrate_branch.py --branch feat/my-branch --dry-run
python scripts/migration/migrate_branch.py --branch feat/my-branch --execute
```

#### 5.2 Import Converter
```bash
# Convert imports in specific files
python scripts/migration/convert_imports.py --file my_file.py
python scripts/migration/convert_imports.py --directory my_directory/
```

#### 5.3 Validation Script
```bash
# Validate branch after migration
python scripts/migration/validate_branch.py --branch feat/my-branch
```

### Phase 6: Timeline & Milestones

#### Week 1 (Current)
- [x] **Complete core migration** (Phases 0-8)
- [ ] **Create migration tools**
- [ ] **Communicate with team**
- [ ] **Start high-priority branch migrations**

#### Week 2
- [ ] **Migrate remaining active branches**
- [ ] **Complete Phase 9: Import Cutover**
- [ ] **Validate all integrations**

#### Week 3
- [ ] **Complete Phase 10: Final Cleanup**
- [ ] **Remove old compatibility layer** (optional)
- [ ] **Update documentation**

### Phase 7: Risk Mitigation

#### 7.1 Backup Strategy
- **Full repository backup** before major changes
- **Branch-specific backups** before individual migrations
- **Rollback plan** if issues arise

#### 7.2 Testing Strategy
- **Maintain existing tests** throughout migration
- **Add new tests** for new import paths
- **Comprehensive validation** at each step

#### 7.3 Communication Plan
- **Daily standups** during migration period
- **Slack/Teams updates** on migration progress
- **Documentation updates** as we go

### Phase 8: Post-Migration Support

#### 8.1 Ongoing Support
- **Help team members** with branch migrations
- **Resolve import issues** quickly
- **Maintain documentation** and examples

#### 8.2 Monitoring
- **Track migration progress** per branch
- **Monitor for issues** after migration
- **Collect feedback** from team members

## Migration Tools (To Be Created)

### 1. Branch Migration Script
- Automatically converts imports in entire branch
- Preserves git history
- Provides rollback capability
- Runs validation tests

### 2. Import Path Converter
- Converts old import paths to new ones
- Handles complex import scenarios
- Preserves code formatting
- Supports dry-run mode

### 3. Validation Script
- Verifies all imports work correctly
- Runs existing tests
- Checks for breaking changes
- Provides detailed report

## Team Member Action Items

### For All Team Members:
1. **Read this migration strategy**
2. **Back up your current work**
3. **Test compatibility layer** with your branch
4. **Plan your migration timeline**
5. **Communicate any blockers**

### For Branch Owners:
1. **Prioritize your branches** for migration
2. **Create backup branches** before migrating
3. **Use provided migration tools**
4. **Test thoroughly** after migration
5. **Update any documentation**

### For New Work:
1. **Use new import paths** (`dana.*`) for all new code
2. **Follow new directory structure** when creating files
3. **Reference migration documentation** for examples
4. **Ask for help** if needed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **All active branches** migrate successfully
- [ ] **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- [ ] **All tests pass** after migration
- [ ] **Team members comfortable** with new structure
- [ ] **Documentation updated** and accurate
- [ ] **Clean git history** preserved

**Remember: The compatibility layer ensures your existing code continues to work. Migration is about adopting the new structure, not fixing broken code.**
