# Concurrency Model

*(This document is a placeholder and needs to be populated with details about Dana's approach to concurrency and asynchronous operations.)*

## Key Aspects to Consider/Cover:

* Motivation: Why is concurrency needed in Dana? (e.g., non-blocking I/O for resource calls, parallel execution of agent tasks).
* Model Choice:
 * Async/Await (similar to Python/JS)?
 * Goroutines/Channels (Golang-inspired)?
 * Actor Model?
 * Event-driven architecture?
* Syntax: How are concurrent operations defined and managed in Dana syntax?
* State Management: How does concurrency interact with `SandboxContext` and variable scopes? Ensuring thread-safety or appropriate isolation.
* Resource Handling: How do concurrent operations interact with `Resource` capabilities? Non-blocking calls to external APIs.
* Error Handling: How are errors propagated and handled in concurrent or asynchronous operations? (See also `error_handling.md`).
* Synchronization Primitives: If needed, what primitives will be available (e.g., locks, semaphores, channels)?
* Integration with IPV: Can IPV-enabled functions be called concurrently/asynchronously?
* Impact on REPL: How does the REPL handle asynchronous results?
* Current Status: Is concurrency a feature for the initial version or a future enhancement?
 * If future, what are the implications for current design choices?

*Self-reflection: Given Dana's use in agents and potential for I/O-bound tasks (calling LLMs, external tools), an async/await model might be a natural fit, but this needs careful consideration against Dana's philosophy of simplicity and determinism where possible.*
