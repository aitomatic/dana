# Archive Index

This directory contains historical documentation snapshots. They are preserved for reference and migration only.

Rules:
- Never link to `.archive` from active documentation.
- Each archived batch must include a `reason.md` and `migration.md` in a dated subdirectory: `YYYY-MM-DD/`.
- Keep archives for at least 6 months; compress older archives if desired.

Layout example:
```
docs/.archive/2024-12-13/
  reason.md
  migration.md
  [...archived files]
```
