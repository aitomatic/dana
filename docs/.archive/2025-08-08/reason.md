## Why archived
Content not part of the streamlined docs sprint plan structure (kept reference minimal and focused).

## Replaced by
- `docs/reference/language.md`
- `docs/reference/api.md`
- `docs/core-concepts.md`

## Migration
Consolidate language details into `docs/reference/language.md`. Keep design documents in archive for historical reference only.

## Impact
None to active docs. Improves clarity and reduces maintenance.
