# Examples Guide

Standards for examples used across Quickstart, Cookbook, Primers, and Reference.

Requirements:
- Copy-paste-run with no edits.
- Include expected output for verification.
- Prefer Dana vs Python comparison when illustrating benefits.
- Use realistic model names and endpoints.
- Add minimal but real error handling for production readiness.
- Keep examples focused; ≤ 50 lines unless a full app is required.

Execution/Validation:
- Test using `docs/.ai/validation/validate-examples.sh`.
- Ensure compatibility with latest PyPI `dana-lang`.

Don’t:
- Reference `.archive` or internal-only tools.
- Use toy placeholders like foo/bar; use meaningful data.
