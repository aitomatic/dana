# Cookbook Recipe Guide

Goal: Practical “How to …” recipes that demonstrate Dana’s advantage over Python equivalents.

Recipe rules:
- Title: “How to [specific task]”.
- Structure: Problem → Solution → Result.
- Code: ≤ 50 lines per example; include Dana and Python versions where useful.
- Include performance notes (time/resources) when relevant.
- Include error handling and edge cases.
- Provide expected output so users can verify quickly.
- Validate with current PyPI.

Use the template at `docs/.ai/templates/cookbook-recipe.md`.

Common topics:
- Multi-agent chat, data pipelines, API orchestration, error recovery.
- Tools/integration patterns that appear in community questions.

Avoid:
- Abstract examples (foo/bar/baz); always realistic LLM scenarios.
- “Coming soon” placeholders – use preview branch instead if needed.
