### Core Concepts (One-Page Overview)

Dana is a Python-like language and runtime for building AI agents and multi-agent systems quickly.

- Agents: Encapsulate behavior and interact via messages.
- Workflows: Compose steps/tasks; focused on reliability and clarity.
- Poet: Fault tolerance, determinism, and learning primitives.
- Python interop: Import and use Python packages directly.
