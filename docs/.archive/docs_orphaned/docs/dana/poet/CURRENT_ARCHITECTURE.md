# POET Current Architecture (Corrected)

## Key Finding: Engineers Write Simple Business Logic, POET Provides Enterprise Infrastructure

After analyzing the actual POET implementation and examples, the correct architecture is:

### What Engineers Actually Write
```dana
@poet(domain="financial_services", retries=3)
def assess_credit_risk(credit_score: int, income: float, debt_ratio: float) -> str:
    # Simple business logic only (5-10 lines)
    if credit_score >= 750 and debt_ratio <= 0.3:
        return "approved"
    elif credit_score >= 650 and debt_ratio <= 0.45:
        return "conditional"
    else:
        return "declined"
```

### What POET Runtime Automatically Provides

#### POEExecutor Implementation
Located in `opendxa/dana/poet/mvp_poet.py`:
- **P (Perceive)**: Domain plugin input processing
- **O (Operate)**: Your function + retry logic + timeout handling
- **E (Enforce)**: Domain plugin output validation + compliance
- **T (Train)**: Optional parameter learning

#### 4 Production Domain Plugins
Located in `opendxa/dana/poet/domains/`:
1. **financial_services.py**: Input normalization, FCRA compliance
2. **building_management.py**: Equipment protection, energy optimization
3. **semiconductor.py**: Process validation, SPC monitoring
4. **llm_optimization.py**: Prompt optimization, quality validation

### Intelligence Distribution: 80% Common + 20% Domain
- **80% Common Infrastructure**: Retry logic, timeout handling, error recovery (POEExecutor)
- **20% Domain Intelligence**: Industry-specific input/output processing (Domain plugins)

### Architecture Benefits
- **Engineers**: Write 5-10 lines instead of 50+ lines
- **Automatic Enterprise Capabilities**: Reliability, compliance, monitoring
- **Domain Expertise**: Industry intelligence without domain knowledge
- **90% Code Reduction**: Focus on business logic, not infrastructure

This matches the intended design where the O (Operate) function contains minimal business logic while P/E/T provide the enterprise infrastructure.
