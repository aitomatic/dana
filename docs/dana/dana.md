# DANA (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture)

## 🧭 Vision

DANA is a universal program format and execution runtime that enables intelligent agents — human or machine — to reason, act, and collaborate through structured, interpretable programs.

It serves as the missing link between natural language objectives and tool-assisted, stateful action. DANA programs are concise, auditable, explainable, and can be authored by LLMs, domain experts, or both.

---

## 💡 Motivation & Problem

Modern AI systems struggle with:

* ✖️ **Prompt chains are fragile** — hard to debug, hard to maintain
* ✖️ **Plans are opaque** — impossible to inspect or explain mid-flight
* ✖️ **Tool use is scattered** — logic is buried in code, not declarative programs
* ✖️ **State is implicit** — no shared memory model or traceable updates

Symbolic systems offer structure but lack adaptability. LLMs offer creativity but lack transparency. DANA bridges the two.

---

## ✅ Solution

DANA introduces a lightweight domain-aware program language and runtime. It allows:

* 🧠 **Programs as first-class reasoning artifacts**
* 📦 **Shared state containers** (`agent`, `world`, `temp`, `execution`)
* 🧩 **Reusable logic units** via a structured Knowledge Base (KB)
* 🧾 **Declarative goals**, **imperative execution**
* 📜 **Bidirectional mapping to/from natural language**

DANA can:

* Be generated by a planning agent (like GMA)
* Be executed line-by-line by a runtime
* Interact with tools, LLMs, and memory
* Be stored, versioned, tested, and explained

## 🔄 Architecture Overview

### Emitters and Interpreters of DANA

| Actor             | Type               | Role(s) in DANA            | Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User (Human)**  | Person             | 🖋 Emitter                 | Writes DANA directly to define goals, logic, or KB entries         |
| **GMA**           | Agent              | 🖋 Emitter                 | General planner that emits DANA plans from objectives              |
| **DXA**           | Domain Agent       | 🖋 Emitter                 | Emits specialized domain logic/workflows, often tied to KB content |
| **KB Maintainer** | Person or Agent    | 🖋 Emitter                 | Curates reusable DANA programs as structured knowledge             |
| **Tool Resource** | System Component   | ✅ Interpreter              | Executes atomic tool-backed actions referenced in DANA             |
| **Local Runtime** | System Component   | ✅ Interpreter              | Executes DANA deterministically except for `reason(...)`           |
| **DANA_LLM**      | LLM Wrapper Module | 🖋 Emitter + ✅ Interpreter | Emits code and executes reasoning operations                       |
| **AgentRuntime**  | System Component   | 🔁 Coordinator             | Orchestrates execution and manages delegation across all actors    |

### State Model

DANA programs operate over a shared `RuntimeContext`, which is composed of four memory scopes (state containers):

| Scope      | Description                                                      |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `local:`   | Local to the current agent/resource/tool/function (default scope)|
| `private:` | Private to the agent, resource, or tool itself                   |
| `public:`  | Openly accessible world state (time, weather, etc.)              |
| `system:`  | System-related mechanical state with controlled access           |

> **Note:** Only these four scopes are valid in the DANA language and enforced by the parser. Any references to other scopes (such as `agent:`, `world:`, `temp:`, `stmem:`, `ltmem:`, `execution:`, or custom scopes) are not supported in the current grammar and will result in a parse error.
