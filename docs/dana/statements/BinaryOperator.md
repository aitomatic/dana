### BinaryOperator
- **Description**: Represents the set of binary operators available within the DANA language. These operators are used to perform operations between two operands in expressions.

- **Operators**:
  - EQUALS (==): Checks if the two operands are equal. Returns True if they are, otherwise False.
  - NOT_EQUALS (!=): Checks if the operands are not equal. Returns True if they differ, otherwise False.
  - LESS_THAN (<): Checks if the left operand is smaller than the right operand. Returns True if it is, otherwise False.

- **Usage Example**:
  

- **Context**: These operators are generally used within conditional statements, loops, and other control structures to determine the flow of execution based on the evaluation of the expressions they form part of.
