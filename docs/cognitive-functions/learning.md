# Learning in OpenDXA

Note for expansion: Learning is done through a number of mechanisms:

- **Experience-based learning:**
  - Learning from past experiences
  - Updating beliefs and knowledge based on new information
  - Improving performance over time

- **Model-based learning:**
  - Learning from a model of the world
  - Updating beliefs and knowledge based on new information
  - Improving performance over time

- **Reinforcement learning:**
  - Learning from a model of the world
  - Updating beliefs and knowledge based on new information
  - Improving performance over time

The knowledge base is the primary mechanism for learning in OpenDXA. It is a collection of all the information that the agent has learned over time.
