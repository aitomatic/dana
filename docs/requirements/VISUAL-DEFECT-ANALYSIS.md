# Manufacturing Quality Control Visual Analysis Requirements

## Business/Technical Problem Statement

### Persona
**Sarah Chen, Quality Control Inspector**
- 5+ years experience in semiconductor manufacturing quality control
- Responsible for visual inspection of critical components
- Must maintain high throughput while ensuring accuracy
- Works across multiple production lines and product types
- Reports to the Quality Assurance Manager

### Use Case
Sarah needs to quickly identify and classify defects in semiconductor components during the manufacturing process. She must determine the root cause of defects, assess their severity, and recommend appropriate corrective actions to prevent production delays and quality issues.

### Scenario
During a routine inspection of a batch of semiconductor wafers, Sarah notices unusual patterns of defects that she hasn't encountered before. She needs to:
1. Capture high-resolution images of the defects
2. Analyze the defect patterns against known defect databases
3. Determine if the defects are critical or minor
4. Identify potential root causes based on historical data
5. Recommend immediate corrective actions
6. Document her findings for quality records and shift handover

Sarah is under pressure to complete this analysis quickly as the production line may need to be adjusted or stopped depending on her findings. She needs a system that can help her make accurate assessments rapidly while providing comprehensive documentation.
