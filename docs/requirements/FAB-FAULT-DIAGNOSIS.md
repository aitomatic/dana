# Fab Domain Expert Agent (DXA) Requirements

## Business/Technical Problem Statement

### Persona
**Michael Chen, Semiconductor Process Engineer**
- 10+ years experience in semiconductor manufacturing
- Responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting RIE (Reactive Ion Etch) equipment
- Must maintain high throughput while ensuring process quality
- Works across multiple tools and process types
- Reports to the Fab Engineering Manager

### Use Case
Michael needs to continuously monitor RIE equipment for process issues and diagnose faults in real-time. He must identify potential problems before they impact production, determine root causes, and recommend appropriate corrective actions to prevent downtime and quality issues.

### Scenario
During a routine process check, Michael notices unusual behavior in one of the RIE tools. He needs to:
1. Review real-time SPC and FDC data from the affected tool
2. Analyze parameter trends for anomalies
3. Identify potential root causes based on historical data
4. Determine if immediate intervention is required
5. Recommend specific corrective actions
6. Document his findings for the maintenance team

Michael is under pressure to diagnose and resolve the issue quickly as the affected tool is critical to the current production lot. He needs a system that can help him monitor complex process data continuously and provide actionable insights when issues arise.

## Scenario Overview
