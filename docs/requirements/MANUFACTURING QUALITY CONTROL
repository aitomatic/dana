Manufacturing Quality Control Visual Analysis Requirements Document
This document describes the requirements for manufacturing quality control teams who need to analyze product defects and degradation patterns through visual inspection using aiKO in a single conversation.
Use Case Scenario
Manufacturing quality control personnel frequently need to analyze products for defects, degradation, or quality issues. Users capture images of products showing potential defects or quality concerns that need to be matched against known defect patterns for diagnosis and resolution. The system must be able to analyze surface characteristics, identify defect patterns, and match against a knowledge base of known issues to provide resolution steps and root cause analysis.
Primary Function Description
Actors:

End User (Quality Control Inspector/Engineer)
DXA System


Goal
Enable quality control personnel to receive immediate analysis of product defects through visual inspection, matching against known patterns, and providing actionable quality control measures without requiring permanent storage of specific defect images.
Context
User Context:

Users need rapid defect classification and diagnosis
Users require comparison against known defect patterns
Users need root cause identification
Analysis must account for:
  Product type and specifications
  Production line parameters
  Environmental conditions

Results must include corrective actions

System Access Requirements:

Access to defect pattern database
Access to quality control specifications
Access to historical defect resolutions
Access to production process parameters
Ability to process image files:
  High-resolution photos




System Architecture
Consultation/Process Flow:

Initiation Phase

User uploads product defect image
User specifies:

Product type/code
Production line/batch
Known process parameters
Observed issue description


System validates image quality and metadata
System identifies product type and specifications


Analysis Phase

Image preprocessing and enhancement
Defect feature extraction
Surface pattern analysis
Dimensional analysis if applicable
Color/texture analysis if applicable
Pattern matching against known defects



Action Planning

For defect classification:

Match against known defect types
Assess severity level
Identify affected product characteristics


For root cause analysis:

Link to known process issues
Identify critical process parameters
Generate investigation checklist


For corrective actions:

Provide immediate containment steps
List required process adjustments
Specify quality verification steps




Execution Phase

Generate defect analysis report
Provide reference images of similar defects
Detail corrective actions
Specify verification requirements



Information Exchange

Present findings in standard QC format
Show visual comparisons with known defects
Handle follow-up technical questions
Maintain product context throughout exchange


Solution Processing
