## Business/Technical Problem Statement

### Persona
**Robert Johnson, Maintenance Technician**
- 12+ years experience in industrial equipment maintenance
- Responsible for maintaining and repairing various types of machinery
- Must quickly identify replacement parts to minimize downtime
- Works across multiple facilities and equipment types
- Reports to the Maintenance Supervisor

### Use Case
Robert needs to quickly identify parts and components through image analysis to retrieve accurate part numbers and inventory information. He must match visual characteristics of parts to database records, find replacement options, and determine availability to minimize equipment downtime.

### Scenario
During an emergency repair of a critical production machine, Robert needs to replace a damaged component. He needs to:
1. Capture a clear image of the damaged part
2. Upload the image to the parts identification system
3. Analyze the part's visual characteristics
4. Match the part to the parts catalog database
5. Find replacement options with inventory availability
6. Order the correct replacement part

Robert is under pressure to identify and order the correct replacement part quickly as the production line is down, costing thousands of dollars per hour in lost production. He needs a system that can help him accurately identify parts from images and provide immediate inventory information.

## Scenario Overview

This document describes the requirements for users who need to identify parts and components through image analysis to retrieve accurate part numbers and inventory information using DXA in a single conversation.

### System Components

1. **Image Processing System**
   - Image preprocessor
   - Feature extractor
   - Pattern analyzer
   - Dimension estimator
   - Material identifier

2. **Knowledge Base**
   - Parts catalog database
   - Technical specifications
   - Inventory data
   - Supplier information
   - Equipment models

3. **Analysis Engine**
   - Part identification
   - Pattern matching
   - Alternative finder
   - Specification matcher
   - Sourcing analyzer

4. **Reporting System**
   - Identification report generator
   - Specification display
   - Inventory checker
   - Sourcing information
   - Alternative part browser

### Example Scenario: Part Identification Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant D as DXA
    participant K as Knowledge Base
    participant I as Inventory
    
    U->>D: Upload part image
    D->>D: Preprocess image
    D->>K: Query part catalog
    D->>D: Analyze features
    D->>D: Match patterns
    D->>I: Check inventory
    D->>U: Generate report
```
