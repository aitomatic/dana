Semiconductor System Log Analysis Requirements Document
This document describes the requirements for semiconductor customers who need to analyze system log files for error detection and parameter validation using aiKO in a single conversation.
Use Case Scenario
Semiconductor engineers and technicians frequently need to analyze system log files to diagnose issues and validate system parameters. These logs contain specific codes and parameters that need to be analyzed for anomalies, error patterns, and out-of-spec conditions. The analysis must cross-reference system specifications, known error patterns, and parameter tolerances to provide actionable insights. While the analysis patterns may be reused, individual log files should not be stored permanently due to proprietary system information.
Primary Function Description
Actors:
Customer
FAE (Field Application Engineer)
DXA System

Goal
Enable FAE to receive immediate analysis of system log files for error detection, parameter validation, and anomaly identification, providing actionable insights without storing proprietary system data.

User Context:
Users need rapid analysis of system log files for troubleshooting
Users require parameter validation against specification limits
Users need to identify error patterns and root causes
Analysis must account for different tool types and configurations
Results must reference relevant technical documentation in knowledgebase


System Access Requirements:

Access to system specification databases
Access to error code libraries and resolution steps
Access to parameter tolerance specifications
Access to tool configuration databases
Ability to process log files in standard formats:

[NEEDS INPUT: List of proprietary log formats]
Text logs (.txt, .log)
CSV files
System-specific binary formats [NEEDS INPUT: Details needed]
