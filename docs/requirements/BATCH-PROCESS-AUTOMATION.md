## Business/Technical Problem Statement

### Persona
**Jennifer Martinez, Process Engineer**
- 7+ years of experience in specialty chemicals manufacturing
- Responsible for optimizing batch processes and ensuring product quality
- Must maintain consistent product quality while maximizing throughput
- Works across multiple production lines and product types
- Reports to the Production Manager

### Use Case
Jennifer needs to optimize batch processes in specialty chemicals manufacturing to ensure consistent product quality, maximize throughput, and minimize waste. She must monitor process parameters, identify optimization opportunities, and implement improvements to meet production targets and quality standards.

### Scenario

1. Review historical batch data to identify patterns in successful vs. failed batches
2. Analyze current process parameters against optimal ranges
3. Identify potential optimization opportunities
4. Develop and test process improvements
5. Implement changes across multiple batch reactors
6. Monitor results and document improvements

Jennifer is under pressure to improve the process quickly as the current quality variations are affecting customer satisfaction and increasing production costs. She needs a system that can help her analyze complex process data, identify optimization opportunities, and implement improvements across multiple batch reactors.
