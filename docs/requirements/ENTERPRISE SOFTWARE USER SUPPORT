Enterprise Software Screenshot Analysis Requirements Document
This document describes the requirements for enterprise software users who need to verify data entry, troubleshoot errors, and understand form requirements through screenshot analysis using aiKO in a single conversation.
Use Case Scenario
Enterprise software users frequently need assistance with data entry validation and error resolution in complex enterprise systems. Users capture screenshots of their current system state, which may include data entry forms, error messages, or system interfaces. These screenshots need to be analyzed for data accuracy, error diagnosis, and field requirement clarification. The analysis must reference system documentation and historical data patterns but should not be permanently stored due to potential sensitive information in the screenshots.
Primary Function Description
Actors:

End User (Enterprise Software User)
DXA System

Goal
Enable enterprise software users to receive immediate validation and guidance on their data entry, error messages, and form requirements by analyzing interface screenshots, without storing potentially sensitive system information.
Context
User Context:

Users need immediate verification of data entry against historical patterns
Users encounter error messages requiring interpretation and resolution steps
Users need clarification on required vs optional fields
Users may be unfamiliar with specific interface sections
Analysis must account for enterprise system version [NEEDS INPUT: Which versions?]

System Access Requirements:

Access to enterprise system interface templates and layouts
Access to historical data patterns [NEEDS INPUT: Retention period for historical data?]
Access to error code database and resolution steps
Access to field requirement documentation
Ability to process screenshots in common formats (png, jpg, pdf)
Access to system version documentation [NEEDS INPUT: Documentation format/location?]

System Architecture
Consultation/Process Flow:

Initiation Phase

User captures and uploads interface screenshot
User indicates concern type (data validation/error resolution/field requirements)
System validates screenshot quality and readability
System identifies interface version and screen type


Analysis Phase

Interface element recognition and mapping
Error message extraction and parsing
Data field content extraction
Version-specific template matching
OCR for error codes and field contents
Pattern matching against known valid data formats


Action Planning

For data validation:

Compare extracted values against historical patterns
Identify potential data entry issues
Prepare validation response


For error resolution:

Match error codes to known issues
Generate step-by-step resolution path


For field requirements:

Identify mandatory vs optional fields for the current process
List dependencies between fields
Provide field format requirements




Execution Phase

Generate context-specific guidance
Provide relevant historical data comparisons
List specific correction steps if needed
Reference relevant documentation sections


Information Exchange

Present findings in user-friendly format
Provide specific correction recommendations
Handle follow-up questions about suggested actions
Maintain interface context throughout exchange


Solution Processing

Compile verification results
Generate step-by-step guidance
Format response based on issue type
Include relevant system documentation references
