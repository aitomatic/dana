Parts Identification System Requirements Document
This document describes the requirements for users who need to identify parts and components through image analysis to retrieve accurate part numbers and inventory information using aiKO in a single conversation.
Use Case Scenario
Maintenance technicians, field service personnel, and procurement staff frequently need to identify replacement parts without having access to part numbers or documentation. Users capture images of components (either intact or damaged) that need to be matched against existing inventory databases to retrieve correct part numbers, specifications, and availability information. The system must be able to identify parts across multiple angles and conditions, including partially damaged components, to provide accurate identification and sourcing information.
Primary Function Description
Actors:

End User (Maintenance Technician/Service Personnel/Procurement Staff)
DXA System
Inventory Management System

Goal
Enable users to quickly and accurately identify parts and components through visual analysis, matching against inventory databases to retrieve correct part numbers and specifications, while handling variations in component condition and orientation.
Context
User Context:

Users need rapid part identification in the field
Users may have damaged or worn components

Users require matching the image of a part to its identification to access:

Part numbers
Specifications
Inventory availability



Analysis must work with:

Various lighting conditions
Multiple viewing angles
Partial components
Weathered/worn parts



System Access Requirements:

Access to parts catalog database
Access to technical specifications
Access to inventory management system
Access to supplier databases

Integration with:

ERP system 
Procurement system
Supplier portals


Ability to process images from:

Mobile devices
Digital cameras


System Architecture
Consultation/Process Flow:

Initiation Phase

User uploads component image
User provides optional context:

Equipment type/model
Application area
Known specifications


System validates image quality
Initial component category identification


Analysis Phase

Image preprocessing
Feature extraction:

Shape analysis
Dimensional estimation
Material identification
Distinguishing features


Multiple angle analysis if provided
Damage/wear compensation
Pattern matching against catalog


Action Planning

For part identification:

Match against known components
List potential matches with confidence levels
Identify critical specifications


For sourcing:

Check inventory availability
List alternative parts
Identify suppliers
Check lead times




Execution Phase

Generate identification report
Provide reference catalog images
List specifications and tolerances
Include sourcing options


Information Exchange

Present findings with confidence levels
Show visual comparisons
