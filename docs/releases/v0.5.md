## Dana v0.5 Release Notes  

### What’s New  
- **Agent Studio:** Describe your problem and get a draft expert agent with three components — **agent, resources, workflows**. Studio suggests a workflow you can run right away.  
- **Extend with resources:** Ground your agent with documents, generated knowledge, or web search. Studio now guides you through setup.
- **Workflows:** Tweak the workflows to fit your needs directly in the Code interface inside the Studio.  
- **Agent-Native Language/runtime:** Runtime for more reliable execution, concurrency, and stronger knowledge grounding.  

### Improvements & Fixes  
- Improvement on first-time user experience.
- Workflow execution is more stable with clearer error messages and validation in `.na`.  
- Examples and docs are simpler — runnable examples are now in the `examples/` folder.  

### Coming Next  
- **Resources: Database** Direct connections to databases for grounding and retrieval.  
- **Workflow:** Agents can automatically decide on the best plan to follow when there's no preferred workflow
