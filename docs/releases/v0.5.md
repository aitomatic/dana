# Dana v0.5 Release Notes

### Build your first agent in 30 minutes
Dana v0.5 introduces **Agent Studio**, the fastest path to building and testing expert agents locally. In under 30 minutes, engineers can install Dana, describe a problem, and generate a working agent with workflows ready to run.

### What’s New
- **Agent Studio:** Generates a draft agent from a problem statement with three components — **agent, resources, workflows**. A runnable workflow is provided by default.
- **Resource integration:** Extend agents with documents, generated knowledge, or web search. Guided setup included.
- **Workflow editing:** Edit and customize workflows directly in Studio’s code view.
- **Deployment:** Run agents as REST APIs directly from Studio or the CLI for integration into your systems.
- **Language & Runtime:** The agent-native programming language and runtime brings deterministic execution, concurrency by default, and strong knowledge grounding. For those who prefer code, work on Dana files (`.na`) directly in your favorite IDE.

### Improvements
- Quicker launch for Studio and REPL.
- Stable workflow execution with clearer validation and error reporting.
- Streamlined examples and documentation; runnable examples now in `examples/`.

### Coming Next
- **Database resources:** Expand agent knowledge and context with direct database connection.
- **Smarter workflows:** Agents that automatically choose the best plan when one isn’t provided.

### Upgrade
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -U dana
# or
