## What is OpenDXA?

OpenDXA (Domain-eXpert Agent) Framework transforms AI development from brittle, unpredictable systems to reliable, auditable automations. Built on the Dana language - a neurosymbolic programming environment - OpenDXA enables intelligent multi-agent systems with domain expertise.

### ‚ú® Key Benefits
- Transparent: Every step is visible and debuggable through imperative programming
- üõ°Ô∏è Reliable: Built-in verification and error correction with structured state management
- ‚ö° Fast: 10x faster development cycles with clear control flow
- ü§ù Collaborative: Share and reuse working solutions across domains
- Domain-Aware: Seamless integration of specialized knowledge and expertise

### Core Innovation: Dana Language & DANKE Engine

Dana (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture) provides an imperative programming model for agent reasoning:

```dana
# Traditional AI: Opaque, brittle
result = llm_call("analyze data", context=data)

# Dana: Transparent, self-correcting with explicit state management
analysis = reason("analyze data", context=data) # Auto-scoped to local (preferred)
while confidence(analysis) < high_confidence:
 analysis = reason("refine analysis", context=[data, analysis])

# Clear state transitions and auditable reasoning
public:result = analysis
use("tools.report.generate", input=public:result)
```

**DANKE** (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Knowledge Engine) implements the CORRAL methodology:
- Collect: Gather and ingest domain knowledge
- Organize: Structure and index knowledge
- Retrieve: Access and search for relevant knowledge
- Reason: Infer, contextualize, and generate insights
- Act: Apply knowledge to take actions and solve problems
- Learn: Integrate feedback and improve knowledge over time

### Architecture Overview

OpenDXA combines declarative knowledge with imperative execution for maintainable, reliable AI systems:
