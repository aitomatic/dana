# OpenDXA - Domain-Expert Agent Framework Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the OpenDXA framework's architecture, core concepts, features, and design philosophy. For a quick start and installation instructions, please refer to the main [README.md](../../README.md).

## Core Concepts

OpenDXA is built around two fundamental aspects:

1. **Declarative Aspect**
   - Defines what the agent knows
   - Manages knowledge and resources
   - Handles domain expertise
   - Provides structured access to knowledge

2. **Imperative Aspect**
   - Implements planning and reasoning
   - Executes tasks using available knowledge
   - Manages state and context
   - Coordinates multi-agent interactions

For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Documentation](details/architecture.md).

## Key Features

- **Domain Expertise Integration** - Embed expert knowledge into agent behavior
- **Adaptive Knowledge Management** - Support for knowledge lifecycle including evolution and versioning
- **Declarative + Imperative Architecture** - Clear separation of knowledge and action for robust design
- **Agent Learning & Adaptability** - Mechanisms for agents to improve over time
- **Protocol Federation (NLIP)** - Interoperability between different agent communication standards
- **Progressive Complexity** - Start simple, scale to complex tasks
- **Composable Architecture** - Mix and match capabilities as needed
- **Built-in Best Practices** - Pre-configured templates for common patterns
- **Full Customization** - Complete control when needed

## Key Differentiators

### Business/Strategic Differentiators
1. **Declarative-Imperative Architecture**: Clear separation between what agents know and how they act
2. **Knowledge Management**: Built-in support for structured knowledge management and evolution
3. **Domain Expertise Integration**: Specifically designed to embed domain expertise into agents

### Engineering Approaches
1. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple implementations and progressively add complexity
2. **Composable Architecture**: Mix and match components as needed for highly customized agents
3. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Maintain clear boundaries between description and execution layers

For detailed framework comparisons, see [Framework Comparison](details/comparison.md).
