# OpenDXA - Powered by DANA

**Example: DANA agentic program**
```dana
# Local solve: ask for a diagnosis based on temperature
cause = local.solve(f"Diagnose the cause of high temperature: {temp}")

# Remote solve: ask another expert agent for a solution
fix = ai.hvac_expert_agent.solve(f"Suggest a fix for high temperature: {temp}, {cause}")

# Remote plan: get a troubleshooting plan from another agent
plan = ai.hvac_service_agent.plan(f"Plan steps to resolve high temperature: {temp}, {cause}, {fix}")

if is_safe(plan):
  # Execute on the plan
  result = execute(plan)
```

**Example: DANA agentic program (Finance Use Case)**
```dana
import aitomatic as ai

# Obtain applicant's credit score using a remote AI/agent
applicant.credit_score = ai.credit_agent.score(applicant)

# Local reasoning: log and check risk
if applicant.credit_score < 600:
    log(f"Low credit score detected: {applicant.credit_score}")
    # Ask a local function for a risk assessment
    applicant.risk = local.assess_risk(f"Assess risk for credit score: {applicant}")

    # Ask a remote finance expert agent for a recommendation
    recommendation = ai.finance_agent.recommend(f"Should we approve a loan for credit score: {applicant}?")

    # Log the recommendation
    log(f"Finance expert recommendation: {recommendation}")
else:
    log("Credit score is sufficient for standard processing")
```

**Note:**
In DANA, method calls like `credit_scoring_agent.score(applicant)` are automatically converted to a generic agentic call:
```dana
credit_scoring_agent.solve("Score this applicant", applicant)
```
This standardizes agent/service interactions in a human-readable, LLM-friendly way, allowing agents to expose their capabilities as a structured API, or as prompt-driven functions.

OpenDXA is the first agent framework enabled by the **DANA Language** and **DANA Sandbox**â€”a neurosymbolic programming environment that lets Agentic AI Engineers build, test, and share agent logic as straightforward, readable programs. 

**With DANA, you don't have to deal with boilerplate code or infrastructure paradigms like links, nodes, or graphs. You just write agent logicâ€”clear, expressive, and powerfulâ€”like you always have.**

DANA's neurosymbolic architecture gives you the best of both worlds: the flexibility and fault-tolerance of natural language, and the determinism, explainability, and auditability of symbolic programming. 

Agents communicate and share executable knowledge (how-tos) via DANA, enabling a new era of programmable, collaborative AI. The **DANA Sandbox** provides an interactive playground for rapid development, debugging, and experimentationâ€”making agentic AI accessible and productive for every engineer.

# OpenDXA - Domain-Expert Agent Framework Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the OpenDXA framework's architecture, core concepts, features, and design philosophy. For a quick start and installation instructions, please refer to the project's [README.md](../README.md).

## Overview

OpenDXA is a Python framework that enables building intelligent multi-agent systems with domain expertise, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on:

*   **Build Real Experts:** (Using your specific business knowledge - *Domain Expertise Integration*)
*   **Unlock Company Knowledge:** (Connect to your existing data & docs - *Enterprise Knowledge Leverage*)
*   **Manage Evolving Knowledge:** (Smart handling that keeps info current - *Adaptive Knowledge Management*)
*   **Agents That Learn & Improve:** (Get better automatically over time - *Agent Learning & Adaptability*)
*   **Reliable Answers from Your Data:** (Focus on accuracy & consistency - *Structured Knowledge Reliability*)
*   **Clear Design (Know vs. Act):** (Easier to build & maintain - *Declarative + Imperative Architecture*)
*   **Connect Different AI Systems:** (Works well with other tools/platforms - *Protocol Federation/NLIP*)

For our development plans and future capabilities, see the [Development Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

To immediately leverage domain expertise, you can also utilize Aitomatic's separate open-source [Domain Knowledge Base project]([link-to-knowledge-base-repo]) (provides both general technical knowledge and specific domain expertise, e.g., SOPs, taxonomies, specs), which is compatible with any agent framework, including OpenDXA.

> "The real race in AI is the race to get right context to have AI Agents solve the user's problem fully. Organizing or indexing the right data, understanding a domain deeply, getting enough activity for useful memory, and connecting to the right tools. This is the big prize."
>
> â€” Aaron Levie, CEO of Box

> "Domain expertise is key. It's the efficiency of focus."
>
> â€” Christopher Nguyen, CEO of Aitomatic

## ðŸš€ DANA Language & Sandbox: The Heart of OpenDXA Reasoning

OpenDXA's reasoning, planning, and tool use are powered by the **DANA Language** â€” a minimal, interpretable, and LLM-friendly program format. DANA enables agents to reason, act, and collaborate through structured, auditable programs.

**DANA Sandbox** provides an interactive playground for:
- Authoring and testing DANA programs
- Debugging agent logic step-by-step
- Experimenting with new reasoning patterns

**Example DANA program:**
```dana
public.temp = 42
if public.temp > 40:
    log("High temperature detected!")
```

## Why OpenDXA?

OpenDXA stands out by enabling you to build truly expert agents grounded in your specific domain knowledge.

### For Business Users:

*   **Leverage Your *Existing* Knowledge Accurately:** Build agents that tap into your company's documents, databases, and expertise â€“ *how?* using connectors and ingestion tools â€“ ensuring relevance and high fidelity crucial for industrial or financial accuracy.
*   **Embed Deep Domain Expertise:** Go beyond generic AI. Create reliable agents that understand and apply your specialized processes and terminology â€“ *how?* through structured knowledge representation and rule definition â€“ for consistent, compliant results.
*   **Comprehensive & Adaptive Knowledge Management:** Manage the full lifecycle of knowledge. Build agents that learn and adapt as your knowledge base evolves â€“ *how?* via built-in versioning, evolution tracking, and learning mechanisms â€“ maintaining long-term value.
*   **True Interoperability:** Seamlessly connect agents and systems, even those based on different underlying standards (like A2A, MCP) â€“ *how?* by using NLIP as a translation layer â€“ preventing vendor lock-in.

### For Engineering Users:

*   **Integrate Diverse Enterprise Knowledge Sources:** Connect to and represent knowledge from various existing enterprise sources (docs, DBs, APIs) â€“ *how?* using provided APIs and connectors designed for enterprise data formats â€“ simplifying data integration.
*   **Robust & Maintainable Architecture:** The clear separation between *what* an agent knows (declarative) and *how* it acts (imperative) â€“ *how?* enforced by distinct framework modules â€“ facilitates building complex, testable, reliable, and scalable systems, especially with structured knowledge.
*   **Built-in Tools for Advanced Knowledge Management:** Utilize dedicated APIs for the full knowledge lifecycle (capture, structure, versioning, evolution, query) â€“ *how?* through specific classes like `KnowledgeBase` and related utilities â€“ supporting both structured and conceptual data for accuracy and consistency.
*   **Framework Support for Controlled Learning:** Implement agent learning grounded in updates to the managed knowledge base â€“ *how?* via patterns linking feedback loops to knowledge update mechanisms â€“ enabling adaptation while maintaining consistency.
*   **Solve Multi-Protocol Interoperability (NLIP Federation):** Leverage the NLIP implementation â€“ *how?* through specific adapters and translators provided within the framework â€“ to bridge communication between agents built on different standards (A2A, MCP).

## Core Concepts

OpenDXA is built around two fundamental aspects:

1. **Declarative Aspect**
   - Defines what the agent knows
   - Manages knowledge and resources
   - Handles domain expertise
   - Provides structured access to knowledge

2. **Imperative Aspect**
   - Implements planning and reasoning
   - Executes tasks using available knowledge
   - Manages state and context
   - Coordinates multi-agent interactions

For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Documentation](details/architecture.md).
