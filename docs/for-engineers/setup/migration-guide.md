# Migration Guide

*Step-by-step guide for migrating from existing AI frameworks to OpenDXA*

---

## Overview

This guide helps teams migrate from existing AI development frameworks to OpenDXA, providing practical steps, code examples, and best practices for a smooth transition.

## üéØ Migration Strategies

### Parallel Development Approach (Recommended)
- Build new features with OpenDXA alongside existing system
- Gradually migrate components as they prove stable
- Minimize risk while demonstrating value

### Direct Migration Approach
- Replace existing components directly with OpenDXA equivalents
- Faster adoption but higher risk
- Best for greenfield projects or major refactoring

### Hybrid Integration Approach
- Use OpenDXA for specific capabilities while maintaining existing infrastructure
- Gradual adoption with clear integration boundaries
- Ideal for large, complex systems

## üîÑ Framework-Specific Migration

### From LangChain

**Before (LangChain)**:
```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["query"],
    template="Analyze this query: {query}"
)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
result = chain.run("What are the trends?")
```

**After (OpenDXA)**:
```dana
# Configure LLM resource
llm = create_llm_resource(
    provider="openai", 
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.7
)

# Simple reasoning with built-in transparency
result = reason("Analyze this query: What are the trends?")
log("Analysis complete", level="INFO")
```

### From LlamaIndex

**Before (LlamaIndex)**:
```python
from llama_index import GPTVectorStoreIndex, Document
from llama_index.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine

documents = [Document(text="...")]
index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What is the summary?")
```

**After (OpenDXA)**:
```dana
# Create knowledge resource
kb = create_kb_resource(documents=document_list)

# Query with automatic context management
summary = kb.query("What is the summary?")
insights = reason(f"Provide insights based on: {summary}")
```

### From Custom AI Solutions

**Assessment Steps**:
1. Identify core AI workflows in existing system
2. Map existing patterns to OpenDXA capabilities
3. Create parallel implementations for testing
4. Gradually migrate production workloads

**Common Migration Patterns**:
- **Prompt Management** ‚Üí Dana reasoning functions
- **State Management** ‚Üí Built-in context management
- **Error Handling** ‚Üí Transparent execution and logging
- **Integration Points** ‚Üí Resource-based architecture

## üìã Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration Assessment
- [ ] Audit existing AI workflows and dependencies
- [ ] Identify critical integration points
- [ ] Assess team readiness and training needs
- [ ] Plan rollback strategies for each component

### Migration Execution
- [ ] Set up OpenDXA development environment
- [ ] Create parallel implementations of key workflows
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing strategies
- [ ] Monitor performance and reliability metrics

### Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] Verify functional equivalence with existing system
- [ ] Validate performance characteristics
- [ ] Confirm integration stability
- [ ] Document lessons learned and optimizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Tools and Utilities

### Code Analysis Tools
- **Dependency Scanner**: Identify framework-specific dependencies
- **Pattern Matcher**: Find common patterns suitable for OpenDXA migration
- **Complexity Analyzer**: Assess migration complexity for each component

### Migration Assistants
- **Code Generator**: Generate OpenDXA equivalents for common patterns
- **Test Generator**: Create test suites for migrated components
- **Performance Profiler**: Compare before/after performance metrics

## üö® Common Migration Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **State Management**: Mapping existing state to OpenDXA context system
- **Integration Points**: Adapting existing API integrations
- **Performance**: Ensuring equivalent or better performance
- **Testing**: Validating migrated functionality

### Organizational Challenges
- **Team Training**: Getting team up to speed on OpenDXA
- **Change Management**: Managing resistance to new technology
- **Timeline Pressure**: Balancing speed with thorough migration
- **Risk Management**: Minimizing impact on production systems

### Solutions and Best Practices
- Start with non-critical components for learning
- Maintain comprehensive testing throughout migration
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Establish clear rollback procedures

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Development Velocity**: Time to implement new features
- **Debug Time**: Time to identify and fix issues
- **Reliability**: System uptime and error rates
- **Performance**: Response times and resource usage

### Business Metrics
- **Team Productivity**: Developer efficiency improvements
- **Maintenance Cost**: Reduced ongoing maintenance effort
- **Time to Market**: Faster feature delivery
- **Quality**: Reduced bug rates and customer issues
