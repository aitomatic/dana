## What Makes OpenDXA Different

OpenDXA transforms AI development from brittle, unpredictable systems to reliable, auditable automations:

- Transparent: Every step is visible and debuggable
- Reliable: Built-in verification and error correction
- Fast: Dramatically reduced development time
- Collaborative: Share and reuse working solutions

## Core Concepts for Engineers

### Dana Language
Dana is the heart of OpenDXA - a simple, powerful language for AI automation:

```dana
# Load data and analyze
documents = load_documents("contracts/*")
key_points = reason("Extract key terms from {documents}")
summary = reason("Summarize findings: {key_points}")

# Structured data with AI integration
struct Customer:
    name: str
    email: str
    risk_level: str

def assess_risk(customer: Customer) -> str:
    return reason("Assess customer risk level", context=customer)

customer = Customer(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com", risk_level="")
risk = customer.assess_risk()  # Method syntax sugar
```

### Agent Architecture
Build structured agents with clear capabilities:

```python
# Define agent with specific capabilities
agent = Agent("contract_analyzer")
 .with_capabilities(["document_processing", "legal_analysis"])
 .with_resources(["legal_kb", "contract_templates"])
```

### State Management
Clear, scoped state that's always inspectable:

```python
# Organized state scopes
current_task = "contract_review" # Auto-scoped to local (preferred)
private:analysis_results = review_contract(document) # Agent-specific data
public:completion_status = "ready" # Shared state
```

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started Paths

### Path 1: Quick Demo (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install OpenDXA
pip install opendxa

# Run your first agent
opendxa demo chatbot
```

### Path 2: Build from Scratch (15 minutes)
1. [Install OpenDXA](setup/installation.md)
2. [Create your first agent](recipes/first-agent.md)
3. [Test with the REPL](reference/repl-guide.md)

### Path 3: Migrate Existing Code (30 minutes)
1. [Migration Guide](setup/migration-guide.md)
2. Converting LLM calls to Dana (see recipes)
3. Testing and validation (see troubleshooting)

## Quick Examples

### Basic Dana Script
```python
# Simple reasoning and logging
name = "OpenDXA Agent"
analysis = reason("What are the key benefits of this system?", context=specs)
log.info(f"Analysis complete for {name}")

# Load knowledge and process data
use("kb.finance.risk_assessment")
risk_level = reason("Assess portfolio risk", context=portfolio_data)
```

### Object Method Calls & MCP Integration (NEW)
```python
# Connect to MCP services and call methods
websearch = use("mcp", url="http://localhost:8880/websearch")
tools = websearch.list_tools()
results = websearch.search("OpenDXA documentation")

# A2A Agent integration
analyst = use("a2a.research-agent")
market_analysis = analyst.analyze_trends(financial_data)
report = analyst.generate_report(market_analysis)

# Resource management with 'with' statements
with use("mcp.database") as database:
    users = database.query("SELECT * FROM active_users")
    database.update_analytics(users)
```

### Advanced Control Flow
```python
# Process multiple data sources
data_sources = ["api", "database", "files"]

for source in data_sources:
    if source == "api":
        raw_data = fetch_api_data()
    elif source == "database": 
        raw_data = query_database()
    else:
        raw_data = load_file_data()
    
    processed = reason("Clean and validate data", context=raw_data)
    results[source] = processed
```
