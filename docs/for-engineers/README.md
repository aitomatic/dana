## What Makes OpenDXA Different

OpenDXA transforms AI development from brittle, unpredictable systems to reliable, auditable automations:

- Transparent: Every step is visible and debuggable
- Reliable: Built-in verification and error correction
- Fast: Dramatically reduced development time
- Collaborative: Share and reuse working solutions

## Core Concepts for Engineers

### Dana Language
Dana is the heart of OpenDXA - a simple, powerful language for AI automation:

```python
# Load data and analyze
documents = load_documents("contracts/*")
key_points = reason("Extract key terms from {documents}")
summary = reason("Summarize findings: {key_points}")
```

### Agent Architecture
Build structured agents with clear capabilities:

```python
# Define agent with specific capabilities
agent = Agent("contract_analyzer")
 .with_capabilities(["document_processing", "legal_analysis"])
 .with_resources(["legal_kb", "contract_templates"])
```

### State Management
Clear, scoped state that's always inspectable:

```python
# Organized state scopes
current_task = "contract_review" # Auto-scoped to local (preferred)
private:analysis_results = review_contract(document) # Agent-specific data
public:completion_status = "ready" # Shared state
```

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started Paths

### Path 1: Quick Demo (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install OpenDXA
pip install opendxa

# Run your first agent
opendxa demo chatbot
```

### Path 2: Build from Scratch (15 minutes)
1. [Install OpenDXA](setup/installation.md)
2. [Create your first agent](recipes/first-agent.md)
3. [Test with the REPL](reference/repl-guide.md)

### Path 3: Migrate Existing Code (30 minutes)
1. [Migration Guide](setup/migration-guide.md)
2. Converting LLM calls to Dana (see recipes)
3. Testing and validation (see troubleshooting)
