# Debugging and Profiling Dana Programs

*(This document is a placeholder and needs to be populated with details about tools and techniques for debugging and profiling Dana code.)*

## Key Aspects to Cover:

### Debugging

* Error Messages:
 * Clarity and helpfulness of error messages from parser and interpreter.
 * Stack traces: How they are presented, level of detail.
* Logging:
 * The `log()` function as the primary way to trace execution.
 * Configuring log levels or output streams.
* REPL for Debugging: Using the REPL to inspect state, test snippets, and experiment.
* Variable Inspection: How to inspect variable values at runtime (e.g., via `log()` or future debugging tools).
* `__dana_debug_mode` (Conceptual):
 * A system variable `system:__dana_debug_mode` (boolean) that, if true, could enable more verbose logging, additional checks, or expose more internal state.
 * How IPV and other components might alter behavior in debug mode.
* Step-through Debugger:
 * Is a traditional step-through debugger (breakpoints, step-over, step-in) planned?
 * If so, integration with IDEs (e.g., VS Code via Debug Adapter Protocol).
 * Challenges for a language like Dana with potential LLM calls.
* Post-mortem Debugging: Examining state after an error.

### Profiling

* Motivation: Identifying performance bottlenecks, especially in complex agent logic or interactions with external resources (LLMs).
* Metrics: What to measure? (e.g., execution time of functions, resource call latency, token usage for LLMs).
* Tools:
 * Built-in profiling capabilities?
 * Integration with existing Python profiling tools (if Dana calls Python-backed functions/resources).
* `__dana_profile_mode` (Conceptual):
 * A system variable `system:__dana_profile_mode` (boolean or string indicating profile level) to enable collection of performance metrics.
 * How the interpreter and resource calls would record timing/usage data.
* Output: How profiling data is presented (e.g., summary report, flame graphs).

### Visualization
* Visualizing execution flow, especially for complex agent interactions or IPV decision making.
* Visualizing context changes in `SandboxContext`.

*Self-reflection: For early stages, robust logging and informative error messages are key. A full debugger is a significant undertaking. Profiling, especially for LLM interactions, will be important for optimization.*
