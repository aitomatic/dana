# Interfaces with External Systems

*(This document is a placeholder and needs to be populated with details about how Dana programs interface with external systems, focusing on the `Resource` mechanism but also considering other potential integration points.)*

## Key Aspects to Cover:

*   **Core Mechanism: `Resource` Capabilities**
    *   Reiterate the concept of `Resource` capabilities (see `../01_dana_language_specification/capabilities_and_resources.md` - *to be created or linked*).
    *   How Python-defined `Resource` classes are made available to the Dana runtime.
    *   How Dana code invokes methods on these resources (e.g., `private:llm_resource.call("some_prompt")`).
    *   Configuration of resources (e.g., API keys, endpoints) via `SandboxContext` or a dedicated configuration mechanism.
    *   Error handling for resource calls.
    *   Data serialization/deserialization between Dana types and Python types at the resource boundary.
*   **Standard Library of Resources**: What common resources will be provided out-of-the-box? (e.g., HTTP client, file system access, LLM interfaces).
*   **Calling External Python Code**: 
    *   Beyond structured `Resource` capabilities, are there ways to call arbitrary Python functions?
    *   Security implications and sandboxing considerations if this is allowed.
*   **Foreign Function Interface (FFI)**: Any plans for interfacing with code in other languages (e.g., C, Rust)? (Likely a future consideration).
*   **Input/Output**: 
    *   Standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) and how they are handled, especially for `log()`.
    *   File I/O: primarily through a `FileSystemResource`?
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: If Dana agents need to communicate, what mechanisms would be used?
*   **Embedding Dana**: How can the Dana interpreter/sandbox be embedded within a larger Python application?
    *   Programmatic API of the `DanaSandbox` or `DanaInterpreter`.
    *   Passing initial context, retrieving results.

*Self-reflection: The `Resource` model is the primary and safest way for Dana to interact with the outside world. Other mechanisms need careful security and design consideration.*
