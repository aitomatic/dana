# Testing Framework for Dana

*(This document is a placeholder. It will propose a testing framework or guidelines for writing and running tests for Dana programs, functions, and agents. This is crucial for ensuring reliability and maintainability.)*

## Key Considerations for a Dana Testing Framework:

*   **Test Structure and Organization**: 
    *   How test files are named and organized (e.g., `_test.dna` suffix, a dedicated `tests/` directory).
    *   Defining test cases (e.g., as Dana functions with a specific prefix like `test_`).
*   **Test Runner**: 
    *   A command-line tool to discover and execute tests.
    *   Reporting test results (pass, fail, errors, skipped).
    *   Options for verbosity, test filtering (by name, tags).
*   **Assertions**: 
    *   Built-in assertion functions or a dedicated `assert` statement in Dana (e.g., `assert_equal(actual, expected)`, `assert_true(condition)`, `assert_raises(ErrorType, func_to_call)`).
    *   Clear error messages on assertion failures.
*   **Fixtures and Setup/Teardown**: 
    *   Mechanisms for setting up pre-conditions for tests and cleaning up afterwards.
    *   Defining fixtures that can be reused across tests (e.g., a pre-configured `SandboxContext` or mock resources).
    *   Test-level or module-level setup/teardown functions.
*   **Mocking and Patching**: 
    *   Ability to mock Resource methods to isolate tests from external dependencies (LLMs, APIs, databases).
    *   Mocking Dana functions.
    *   Spying on function calls (verifying if a function was called with specific arguments).
*   **Testing `SandboxContext` State**: 
    *   Assertions for checking variable values and types within different scopes of the `SandboxContext` after a test.
*   **Testing IPV-Enabled Functions**: 
    *   Strategies for testing the INFER, PROCESS, and VALIDATE phases independently or together.
    *   Mocking `CodeContextAnalyzer` or LLM calls within IPV.
*   **Testing Agent Behaviors**: 
    *   Higher-level testing for agent decision-making and task orchestration.
    *   Potentially scenario-based testing where an agent is given an initial state and goal, and its actions/outcomes are verified.
*   **Integration with Dana REPL**: 
    *   Ability to quickly run individual tests or test files from the REPL.
*   **Code Coverage**: 
    *   (Future) Tools to measure test coverage for Dana code.
*   **Parametrized Tests**: 
    *   Running the same test logic with different sets of input data.
*   **Tagging and Grouping Tests**: 
    *   Annotating tests with tags (e.g., `unit`, `integration`, `slow`) for selective execution.

## Example (Conceptual Dana Test):

```dana
# in file: my_module_test.dna

# Import module to test (syntax TBD)
# import my_module

func setup_module():
    # Runs once before tests in this file
    system:test_resource = FileSystemResource(base_path: "/tmp/test_dana_fs")
    log("Module setup complete.")

func teardown_module():
    # Runs once after tests in this file
    # system:test_resource.cleanup() # example method
    log("Module teardown complete.")

func test_my_function_adds_correctly():
    private:result = my_module:add(2, 3)
    assert_equal(result, 5, "Addition did not produce 5")

func test_another_feature_with_mocking():
    # Assume a way to mock a resource method for this test's scope
    # system:mock(system:my_llm_resource, "generate_text", returns: "mocked response")
    
    private:output = my_module:process_with_llm("some input")
    assert_contains(output, "mocked", "LLM output not used as expected")
    # assert_called_with(system:my_llm_resource.generate_text, "expected prompt")

```

*Self-reflection: A good testing story is essential for any serious programming language or platform. The Dana testing framework should be intuitive for developers, integrate well with Dana's features (like `SandboxContext` and Resources), and provide robust support for mocking dependencies.*
