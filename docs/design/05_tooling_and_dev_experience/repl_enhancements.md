# REPL Enhancements for Dana

*(This document is a placeholder. It will discuss potential advanced features and improvements for the Dana REPL to make it an even more powerful tool for interactive development, experimentation, and debugging. It cross-references the existing REPL design in `02_dana_runtime_and_execution/repl.md`)*

## Potential REPL Enhancements:

*   **Improved Auto-Completion**: 
    *   Context-aware completion for variable names (all scopes), function names, struct fields, and resource methods.
    *   Completion for file paths if a `FileSystemResource` is active and relevant.

*   **Enhanced Command History**: 
    *   Searchable command history.
    *   Persistent history across sessions (e.g., saved to a file like `~/.dana_history`).

*   **Magic Commands (similar to IPython)**:
    *   `%load <filepath>`: Load and execute a Dana script from a file into the current REPL session.
    *   `%save <filepath> [<range_of_history>]`: Save current session history or specific lines to a file.
    *   `%whos`: List variables in the current `SandboxContext` with their types and values (or summaries).
    *   `%timeit <dana_expression>`: Measure the execution time of a Dana expression.
    *   `%context [scope]`: Inspect the `SandboxContext`, optionally filtering by scope (e.g., `%context private:`).
    *   `%resources`: List available resources and their status.
    *   `%reset_context [scope]`: Clear the entire `SandboxContext` or specific scopes.
    *   `%help <topic|function_name>`: More detailed, context-sensitive help.

*   **Rich Output Display**: 
    *   Pretty-printing for Dana structs and complex data structures.
    *   Potential for rendering basic charts or tables if a result lends itself to it (e.g., if a `matplotlib`-like resource is used and can output to a supported format).

*   **Object/Struct Introspection**: 
    *   Ability to inspect the fields and methods of a struct or resource instance directly in the REPL (e.g., `my_struct?` or `help(my_struct)`).

*   **Session Management**: 
    *   Saving and loading entire REPL sessions (including `SandboxContext` state if feasible and secure).

*   **Better Multiline Editing**: 
    *   More sophisticated handling of indentation and block editing within the REPL prompt itself.
    *   Option to open a temporary buffer in a simple editor (like `nano` or `vim`) for complex multiline inputs.

*   **Customizable Prompt**: Allowing users to customize the REPL prompt string.

*   **Integration with Debugger**: 
    *   Ability to drop into a debugging session from the REPL or vice-versa.
    *   Commands to inspect call stacks or step through code being tested in the REPL.

*   **Profile-based Configuration**: Load different REPL configurations or pre-load certain modules/resources based on a profile.

*Self-reflection: A feature-rich REPL significantly boosts productivity, especially for a language designed for interactive exploration and agent development. Drawing inspiration from tools like IPython/Jupyter would be beneficial.*
