# Inter-Agent Communication (Future)

*(This document is a placeholder for a future design consideration. It will discuss potential mechanisms and protocols for enabling multiple Dana agents, possibly running in different processes or even on different machines, to communicate and collaborate.)*

## Potential Aspects to Consider (for Future Design):

*   **Motivation**: Why is inter-agent communication needed? (e.g., distributed problem solving, specialized agent roles, multi-user collaboration through agents).
*   **Communication Paradigms**: 
    *   **Message Passing**: Agents send messages directly to each other or through a message broker.
        *   Protocols: HTTP-based (REST, WebSockets), custom protocols, message queue systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka via a Resource).
    *   **Shared State/Knowledge Base**: Agents communicate indirectly by reading and writing to a common data store (e.g., a distributed database, a graph database via a Resource).
    *   **Service Calls**: Agents expose capabilities as services that other agents can call (similar to microservices).
*   **Message Content and Format**: 
    *   Standardized message schemas (e.g., using Dana structs serialized to JSON).
    *   Ontologies or shared vocabularies for meaningful communication.
*   **Agent Discovery**: How do agents find each other on a network?
    *   Directory services, registries.
*   **Security and Trust**: 
    *   Authentication and authorization for inter-agent messages.
    *   Encryption of communication channels.
    *   Preventing malicious agents or unauthorized access.
*   **Coordination Mechanisms**: 
    *   Protocols for common interaction patterns (e.g., request-reply, subscriptions, auctions, voting).
    *   Distributed consensus or agreement protocols (if needed for complex collaboration).
*   **Dana Language Support**: 
    *   Would Dana need specific language features to support inter-agent communication, or would this be handled entirely through Resources (e.g., a `MessagingResource`, `DistributedContextResource`)?
*   **Impact on `SandboxContext`**: How would messages or shared state from other agents be represented or influence an agent's local `SandboxContext`?

*Self-reflection: Inter-agent communication is a complex topic, typically addressed in later stages of agent system development. For now, this is a placeholder to acknowledge its potential future relevance. The initial focus will be on single-agent capabilities and orchestration within one Dana runtime.*
