# Agent Model

*(This document is a placeholder. It will outline the conceptual model for agents built using Dana, including their core components, lifecycle, and how Dana serves as the language for defining their behavior and reasoning processes.)*

## Key Aspects to Define:

* Definition of a Dana Agent:
 * An autonomous entity that perceives its environment (or input data), makes decisions (plans), and takes actions (executes capabilities) to achieve goals.
 * Primarily defined by Dana code and configured resources.
* Core Components of a Dana Agent (Conceptual):
 * Perception: How an agent ingests information (e.g., from data sources, user input, sensor feeds via Resources).
 * World Model / State: How an agent maintains its understanding of the current situation. This is largely managed by the `SandboxContext`.
 * Goal Definition: How an agent's objectives are specified (e.g., as Dana structs, initial parameters, or natural language prompts processed by an LLM).
 * Planning/Reasoning Engine:
 * The core logic, often implemented as Dana functions (potentially IPV-enabled like `reason()`).
 * May involve breaking down complex goals into smaller, manageable tasks.
 * Leverages LLMs for complex reasoning, and Dana for deterministic logic and capability orchestration.
 * Action/Execution Engine:
 * Invokes capabilities via Resources (LLMs, tools, APIs).
 * The Dana interpreter executing Dana code that calls resource methods.
 * Learning/Adaptation (Future): How agents might improve their performance over time (e.g., by updating their internal knowledge, refining plans, or even suggesting modifications to their own Dana code).
* Agent Lifecycle:
 * Initialization (loading Dana code, configuring resources, setting initial state).
 * Execution Loop (e.g., perceive-plan-act cycle).
 * Termination/Shutdown.
* Types of Agents:
 * Simple reactive agents.
 * Goal-oriented agents.
 * Potentially more complex BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agents if Dana evolves to support such constructs.
* Role of Dana Language:
 * Defining agent behavior, decision-making logic, and control flow.
 * Orchestrating calls to various capabilities (LLMs, tools, data sources).
 * Managing agent state within the `SandboxContext`.
* Example Agent Structure (Conceptual):
 * A main Dana script defining the agent's primary loop or entry point.
 * Dana functions for specific tasks or behaviors.
 * Configuration for required resources.

*Self-reflection: The Dana agent model should emphasize flexibility, allowing developers to implement a range of agent architectures from simple to complex, with Dana providing the core symbolic control and reasoning glue.*
