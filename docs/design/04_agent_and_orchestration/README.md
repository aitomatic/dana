This section delves into the higher-level constructs for building intelligent agents and orchestrating complex workflows using Dana.

## Documents

*   **[Agent Model](./agent_model.md)**: Describes the conceptual model of a Dana-powered agent, its lifecycle, and core components (e.g., perception, planning, execution).
*   **[Task Orchestration](./task_orchestration.md)**: How sequences of operations, potentially involving multiple capabilities and conditional logic, are defined and managed.
*   **[Workflow Patterns](./workflow_patterns.md)**: Common workflow patterns (e.g., map-reduce, sequential pipelines, state machines) and how they can be implemented in Dana.
*   **[Inter-Agent Communication](./inter_agent_communication.md)**: (Future) Mechanisms for multiple Dana agents to collaborate.
*   **[Human-in-the-Loop](./human_in_the_loop.md)**: Design considerations for integrating human oversight, feedback, and intervention in agent operations.
