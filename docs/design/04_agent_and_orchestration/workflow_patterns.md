# Workflow Patterns in Dana

*(This document is a placeholder. It will explore common workflow patterns and discuss how they can be implemented using Dana's language features and orchestration capabilities. This provides guidance for structuring more complex agent behaviors.)*

## Common Workflow Patterns to Discuss:

* Sequential Pipeline:
 * Description: A series of tasks executed one after another, where the output of one task becomes the input to the next.
 * Dana Implementation: Simple sequence of function calls, with variable assignments passing data.
 * Example: Document processing (load -> extract text -> summarize -> save summary).

* Fan-Out / Fan-In (Map-Reduce Style):
 * Description: A task is parallelized by distributing data to multiple instances of a worker task (fan-out), and then results are aggregated (fan-in).
 * Dana Implementation: Requires concurrency features. A loop to dispatch tasks, mechanisms to collect and aggregate results (e.g., `await all([...])` if applicable).
 * Example: Processing multiple documents in parallel and then combining their summaries.

* State Machine:
 * Description: A workflow that transitions between a finite number of states based on events or conditions. Each state can have entry actions, exit actions, and transitions.
 * Dana Implementation: Using Dana variables to hold the current state, `if/else` or a `switch`-like structure (if Dana has one, or emulated with `if/elif/else`) to handle state-specific logic and transitions. Dana functions can represent state-specific behaviors.
 * Example: A user interaction flow (e.g., greeting -> awaiting input -> processing input -> providing response -> awaiting next input).

* Publish-Subscribe (Event-Driven):
 * Description: Components (tasks or agents) publish events without knowing who the subscribers are, and subscribers react to events they are interested in.
 * Dana Implementation: Would likely require a dedicated event bus/manager resource, or be built on top of Dana's concurrency primitives if they support message passing or event listeners.
 * Example: An agent reacting to changes in a monitored data source.

* Retry and Fallback:
 * Description: If a task fails, retry it a certain number of times, potentially with backoff. If still failing, execute a fallback task or error handling logic.
 * Dana Implementation: `try/catch` blocks combined with loops for retries. Conditional logic for fallback paths.
 * Example: Calling an external API that might be temporarily unavailable.

* Long-Running Workflows / Saga Pattern (More Advanced):
 * Description: Workflows that may span a long duration and involve multiple transactions, requiring compensation logic if a step fails.
 * Dana Implementation: Would require persistent state management beyond a single `SandboxContext` session (e.g., saving state to a database via a resource) and careful design of compensating Dana functions.
 * Example: An order processing system involving inventory checks, payment, and shipping, each being a potentially fallible step.

* Router / Dispatcher:
 * Description: A task that routes input to one of several other tasks based on some criteria.
 * Dana Implementation: `if/elif/else` structures or a function that takes input and returns the name of the next function/task to call.
 * Example: An LLM classifying user intent and Dana routing to the appropriate intent handler function.

## For each pattern:
* Provide a clear description.
* Show a conceptual Dana code snippet or describe the structure.
* Discuss advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.

*Self-reflection: Understanding these patterns will help Dana developers build more robust and maintainable agent systems. The document should focus on practical implementation using Dana's features.*
