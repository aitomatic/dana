# Resource Abstraction Model

*(This document is a placeholder. It will detail the design of the base `Resource` class in Python, how resources are configured, their lifecycle within the `SandboxContext`, and the conventions for defining their methods to be callable from Dana.)*

## Key Aspects to Detail:

* Base `Resource` Class (Python):
 * Core attributes (e.g., `name`, `resource_type`, `status`).
 * Initialization (`__init__`): How configuration is passed and processed.
 * Lifecycle methods (e.g., `setup()`, `teardown()`, `health_check()`).
 * Error handling and reporting mechanisms.
 * Abstract methods or conventions for exposing capabilities.
* Resource Configuration:
 * How configuration data is provided (e.g., via `SandboxContext` `system:resource_config` scope, dedicated config files, environment variables).
 * Schema for resource configuration.
 * Handling of secrets (API keys, passwords).
 * Dynamic reconfiguration (if supported).
* Resource Lifecycle and Management:
 * Registration of resources with the `SandboxContext` or a `ResourceManager`.
 * Instantiation: When and how resources are created (e.g., on-demand, at sandbox startup).
 * State management within a resource instance.
 * Scoping of resources (e.g., session-global, agent-specific).
 * Cleanup and release of resources.
* Defining Resource Methods (Python functions callable from Dana):
 * Naming conventions for methods exposed to Dana.
 * Type handling: How Python types in method signatures map to Dana types (and vice-versa for return values).
 * Serialization/deserialization of complex data (e.g., Dana structs to Python dicts/objects).
 * Context passing: How/if the `SandboxContext` or a subset of it is available to resource methods.
 * Error propagation: How Python exceptions in resource methods are translated to Dana errors.
 * Decorators or other mechanisms for marking methods as Dana-callable and defining their Dana-facing signature (if different from Python signature).
* Asynchronous Operations: How resources handle non-blocking calls (e.g., for I/O bound tasks like API requests).
 * Use of `async/await` in resource methods.
 * Interaction with Dana's concurrency model.
* Resource Versioning (Future Consideration): How different versions of a resource or its provided capabilities are managed.
