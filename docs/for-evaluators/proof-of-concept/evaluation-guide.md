    Context: {context}
    
    Provide helpful response based on context.
    """)
    
    # Quality validation
    quality_score = reason(f"Rate response quality 1-10: {response}")
    
    return {
        "response": response,
        "quality_score": quality_score,
        "context_used": context
    }
