# Core Concepts (v0.5)

Understand the building blocks youâ€™ll use in Quickstart and beyond.

## Agents
Define behaviors that run on a model (e.g., local). Example: see `examples/agents/agent_with_resources_and_workflows/agent_with_resources.na`.

## Resources
Interfaces for IO (files, web search, docs). See `examples/resources/docs/docs_resource.na`, `examples/resources/web_search/web_search_resource.na`, and `examples/resources/webpages/webpages_resource.na`.

## Workflows
Compose steps with control flow. See `examples/workflows/workflow_syntax_sequential.na` (and parallel variants).

## Dana Agent Studio
Inspect runs and iterate: `dana studio`.
