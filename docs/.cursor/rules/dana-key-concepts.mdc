# Dana Key Concepts

Agent

Definition: The core actor in Dana with built-in primitives â€” reasoning, problem solving, planning, memory, and concurrency.

Role: On its own, an agent can already think and act.
ðŸ‘‰ Agent = intelligent actor

Resource

Definition: An explicitly declared gateway to external systems or capabilities (e.g., APIs, databases, RAG documents, Excel, sensors).

Role: Extends what an agent can do by connecting it to the outside world.
ðŸ‘‰ Resources = tools that give agents real-world access

Workflow

Definition: A reusable execution plan that encodes structured knowledge. Not just a one-off run, but a codified sequence of steps an agent can repeatedly execute.

Role: Transforms agents from ad-hoc actors into reliable, repeatable, and scalable executors of knowledge.
ðŸ‘‰ Workflows = knowledge as action
