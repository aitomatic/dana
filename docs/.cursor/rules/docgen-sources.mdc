# Documentation Generation Sources

The following principal sources should be referenced to generate relevant documentation
for developers using Dana to build agentic-AI systems.

## Primers

The directory `dana/docs/primers/` and its nested directories & files discuss
the most important concepts and affordances that developers using Dana should understand
and use to build effective agentic-AI systems based on Dana.

## Specifications

The directory `dana/specs/` and its nested directories & files contain
the design specifications and technical architectures for various components of Dana.

## Curated Examples

The directory `docs/.ai-only/curated_examples/` contains carefully selected and tested
examples that demonstrate best practices and common patterns for building agentic-AI
systems with Dana. These examples serve as reference implementations and should be
consulted when creating documentation that includes code samples.
