# POET Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation documentation for POET (Perceive → Operate → Enforce → Train) in opendxa. POET is the intelligent execution framework that transforms simple business logic into enterprise-grade systems through **~80% generalizable patterns** and **~20% domain-specific intelligence**.

## The POET Intelligence Model

POET's value comes from providing enterprise capabilities that are:

- **80% Generalizable**: Core patterns like error handling, retry logic, performance optimization, and basic learning algorithms work across all domains
- **20% Domain-Specific**: Industry-specific compliance, validation rules, optimization strategies, and business logic patterns
- **AI-Generated Customization**: When pre-built patterns don't fit, AI generates custom plugins for unique enterprise needs

This approach allows engineers to write minimal business logic while POET automatically provides the enterprise infrastructure and domain expertise.

## Quick Reference

### POET Modes
- **POE** (Perceive-Operate-Enforce): Reliability and robustness without learning
- **POET** (Perceive-Operate-Enforce-Train): Full adaptive learning capabilities

### Learning Types
- **Online Learning**: Real-time parameter updates from each execution
- **Batch Learning**: Periodic model updates from accumulated data
- **Hybrid Learning**: Combination of online and batch approaches

### Key Configuration Parameters
```python
@poet(
    # Generalized Intelligence (80% - works everywhere)
    retries=3,                           # Execution reliability
    learning="on",                       # Learning mode: "on", "off", "batch", "hybrid"
    interrupts="auto",                   # Human-in-the-loop: "on", "off", "auto"
    timeout=None,                        # Max execution time
    priority="normal",                   # Execution priority
    
    # Domain-Specific Intelligence (20% - industry specialization)
    domain="financial_services",         # Built-in domain plugin
    plugin_config="config.yaml",         # Custom domain configuration
    plugins=["compliance", "audit"],     # Multiple plugin composition
    
    # AI-Generated Customization (when standard patterns don't fit)
    custom_plugin=ai_generated_plugin,   # AI-created plugin for unique needs
    perceive_handler=None,               # Custom P stage handler
    enforce_handler=None,                # Custom E stage handler
    train_handler=None                   # Custom T stage handler
)
```

### Intelligence Distribution Examples
```python
# 80% Generalized + 20% Built-in Domain (most common)
@poet(domain="manufacturing")
def control_process(temp: float, pressure: float) -> ControlCommand:
    return simple_control_logic(temp, pressure)

# 80% Generalized + 20% Custom Configuration
@poet(domain="financial_services", plugin_config="custom_compliance.yaml")
def assess_risk(data: dict) -> RiskAssessment:
    return basic_risk_calculation(data)

# 80% Generalized + 20% AI-Generated (unique domains)
@poet(custom_plugin=ai_generate_plugin("aerospace_mission_control"))
def mission_control(telemetry: dict) -> MissionCommand:
    return mission_logic(telemetry)
```

## The POET Intelligence Distribution Model

### Why 80/20 Works

**80% Generalizable Intelligence** covers the patterns that work everywhere:
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance optimization and caching  
- Basic learning algorithms and parameter tuning
- Security and audit trail generation
- Resource management and timeout handling
- Quality validation and output formatting

**20% Domain-Specific Intelligence** provides the specialized knowledge that creates real value:
- Financial services: FCRA compliance, credit score normalization, risk thresholds
- Manufacturing: Equipment protection, thermal models, yield optimization  
- Healthcare: HIPAA compliance, clinical validation, diagnostic protocols
- Building management: HVAC optimization, energy efficiency, comfort algorithms

**AI-Generated Customization** fills the gaps for unique enterprise needs:
- Custom compliance frameworks not covered by standard domains
- Proprietary business logic patterns
- Integration with legacy enterprise systems
- Industry-specific optimization strategies

### Usage Patterns by Intelligence Type

```python
# 80% Generalized (works for any function)
@poet()  # Automatic reliability, performance, basic learning

# 80% + 20% Domain (covers 90% of enterprise use cases)  
@poet(domain="financial_services")  # + industry expertise

# 80% + 20% Custom (unique enterprise requirements)
@poet(custom_plugin=ai_generated_plugin)  # + AI-generated intelligence
```
