## Problem Statement
<!-- 
Clearly articulate the problem being solved:
- What is the current situation?
- What are the pain points?
- What is the impact of not solving this problem?
- Include relevant context and background information
- Reference any related issues or discussions

Example:
Python developers need to integrate Dana's AI reasoning capabilities. For this, users should not have to learn a new Dana API. Instead, they should be able to use their familiar Python implementation, and call into Dana whenver desired.
-->

## Goals
<!--
List specific, measurable objectives:
- What does success look like?
- What metrics will be used to measure success?
- What are the key requirements?
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Make goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

Example:
- Python developers should be able to call into Dana whenver desired.
- Dana should be able to call into Python whenver desired.
- The bridge should be secure and efficient.
- The bridge should be easy to use.
-->

## Non-Goals
<!--
Explicitly state what is out of scope:
- Out-of-scope does not mean intentionally excluded, but rather that the design is not addressing it.
- What won't be addressed in this design?
- What are potential misunderstandings to clarify?

Example:
- We will not provide a general-purpose Python import system.
- We do not aim to provide a general-purpose Python import system.
-->

## Proposed Solution
<!--
High-level overview of the solution:
- What is the general approach?
- Why is this approach chosen?
- What are the key components?
- What are the main trade-offs?
- How does this fit into the existing system?

Example:
Consider the following design:

...

## Proposed Design
<!--
Detailed technical design:
- Start with the user/customerâ€™s perspective.
- System architecture and components
- Data models and schemas
- APIs and interfaces
- State management
- Error handling
- Security considerations
- Performance considerations
- Diagrams (sequence, architecture, etc.)
- Edge cases and how they're handled
-->

## Proposed Implementation
<!--
Suggested implementations that satisfy the design requirements. Implementation 
engineers may adapt or modify these based on specific needs or constraints encountered during 
development.

Concrete implementation details:
- Technical specifications
- Code organization
- Key algorithms
- Database changes
- API endpoints
- Configuration changes
- Testing strategy
- Monitoring and logging
- Dependencies and requirements
-->

## Design Review Checklist
<!--
This is to check the above Proposed Solution, Design, and Implementation against the Goals and Non-Goals.
It contains checkboxes that are updated as the design is reviewed.

Key aspects to verify:
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Testing strategy defined
- [ ] Documentation planned
- [ ] Scalability considered
- [ ] Maintenance overhead evaluated
- [ ] Backwards compatibility checked
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Resource requirements estimated
-->

## Implementation Phases
<!--
This is a sequence of phases, including implementation, testing, and if appropriate, deployment.
It is not time-based. It contains checboxes that are updated as the implementation progresses.

Break down the implementation plan:
Phase 1:
- Milestone objectives
- Key deliverables
- Timeline estimates
- Dependencies
- Success criteria

Phase 2:
...

Phase N:
...

Include:
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Rollback plans
- Validation steps
- Stakeholder sign-offs
