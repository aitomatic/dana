# Conceptual and Structured Knowledge Integration

## Overview

A key differentiator for OpenDXA is its ability to seamlessly integrate and leverage both conceptual (often unstructured, text-based) knowledge and structured (database, knowledge graph, API-based) knowledge within a single agentic system.

## The Challenge

Many systems excel at one type of knowledge retrieval but struggle to combine them effectively:
- RAG-focused systems: Strong with documents but may lack precision with structured data or process knowledge.
- Structured data systems: Precise with databases/APIs but often cannot incorporate insights from unstructured text.

## OpenDXA's Approach

*(Explain here how OpenDXA uniquely addresses this challenge. Examples:*)
- *How capabilities can access both types.*
- *How reasoning can synthesize insights from both.*
- *Mechanisms for translating between types.*
- *Benefits for complex enterprise tasks.*

## Why it Matters

*(Explain the advantages:*)
- *More comprehensive understanding.*
- *Improved decision-making accuracy.*
- *Ability to tackle more complex, real-world problems.*
- *Better grounding in enterprise context.*

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Memory and Knowledge](../cognitive-functions/memory-knowledge.md) mechanisms.
- Explore [Capabilities](../core-concepts/capabilities.md) that utilize knowledge.
