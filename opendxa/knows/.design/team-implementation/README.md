# Team Implementation: KNOWS vs RAG MVP Sprint

**🎯 Mission**: Prove KNOWS superiority over RAG through rapid MVP development and head-to-head comparison TONIGHT.

## Quick Navigation

### 📋 Planning Documents
1. **[MVP Implementation Plan](mvp-implementation-plan.md)** - Complete 3D methodology design document
2. **[Team Coordination](team-coordination.md)** - Detailed role assignments and timeline
3. **[Quick Start Templates](quick-start-templates.md)** - Copy-paste code templates for immediate implementation

### 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

#### Team KNOWS Composition:
- **CTN** (Architecture): System design, Dana integration, MVP coordination
- **Sang** (SWE): Core implementation, Dana functions, runtime integration
- **William** (Data Synthesis): Knowledge units, evaluation metrics, testing

#### Team RAG:
- Build competitive baseline with identical use case and evaluation criteria

### ⏰ Timeline (5.5 hours total)
| Phase | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 0** | 30 min | Development environments ready |
| **Phase 1** | 2-3 hours | Core MVP implementations complete |
| **Phase 2** | 1-2 hours | Integration and testing done |
| **Phase 3** | 1 hour | Results documented, demo ready |

### 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] Both agents handle identical test cases
- [ ] KNOWS agent demonstrates ≥20% performance improvement
- [ ] KNOWS agent provides explainable knowledge sources
- [ ] KNOWS agent uses fewer LLM tokens for equivalent results
- [ ] Clear documentation of advantages/trade-offs

## Getting Started

### 1. Immediate Setup (CTN)
```bash
# Run the setup script
mkdir -p opendxa/knows/mvp/{knowledge,composer}
mkdir -p tests/{knows/mvp,comparison}
touch opendxa/knows/mvp/__init__.py
touch opendxa/knows/mvp/composer/__init__.py
```

### 2. Team Assignments
- **CTN**: Start with KnowledgeUnit schema and KnowledgeComposer
- **Sang**: Begin Dana functions setup and runtime integration
- **William**: Create knowledge units and evaluation framework

### 3. Critical Dependencies
1. CTN's KnowledgeUnit schema → Sang's Dana function signatures
2. William's knowledge units → CTN's context composer
3. Sang's Dana agent → William's evaluation framework

## Key Innovations Being Tested

### KNOWS Advantages
- **Structured Knowledge**: P-S-T metadata for contextual relevance
- **Explainable Sources**: Traceable knowledge unit usage
- **Learning Capability**: Feedback integration for improvement
- **Context Optimization**: Efficient token usage through relevance ranking

### Expected Improvements vs RAG
- **Performance**: 20%+ improvement in task completion
- **Efficiency**: Reduced token usage through structured knowledge
- **Explainability**: Clear knowledge source attribution
- **Learning**: Ability to improve through feedback

## Use Case Requirements

**TBD**: Specific use case to be defined, but should have:
- Bounded scope with clear input/output
- Knowledge-dependent success (requires information retrieval/application)
- Measurable outcomes with objective success criteria
- Representative of real-world KNOWS advantages

## Risk Mitigation

### Fallback Plans
- **Dana integration fails**: Use Python wrapper with KNOWS principles
- **Knowledge creation bottlenecks**: Use smaller, focused knowledge set
- **Time overrun**: Reduce scope to core comparison essentials
- **Teams diverge**: Re-align on shared test cases every 30 minutes

## Communication Protocol

### Check-ins
- **Every 30 minutes**: Quick status updates
- **Phase gates**: Formal review before next phase
- **Final demo**: Both teams present results

### Git Workflow
- All work on `feat/knows-team` branch
- Team KNOWS: `opendxa/knows/mvp/` directory
- Team RAG: `opendxa/rag_baseline/` directory
- Frequent commits with clear messages
