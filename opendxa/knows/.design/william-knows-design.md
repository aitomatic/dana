## Problem Statement
**Brief Description**: Domain-expert agents need an intelligent knowledge management system that can both autonomously discover and capture valuable knowledge, and deliver the right knowledge at the right time during task execution.

- **Current Situation**: 
  - Knowledge ingestion is document-centric and passive, missing 60-70% of valuable knowledge
  - Knowledge retrieval requires agents to know what to ask and where to look
  - No intelligent orchestration between what knowledge exists and what agents need
  - Manual processes create bottlenecks and limit knowledge discovery and access
- **Impact**: 
  - Agents struggle with knowledge gaps that could be filled from available sources
  - Critical knowledge remains undiscovered in existing documents
  - Agents waste time searching for knowledge instead of solving problems
  - Inconsistent knowledge access leads to suboptimal decision-making
- **Context**: OpenDXA KNOWS Framework needs a complete intelligent knowledge management system
- **Critical Innovation**: Unified system with autonomous knowledge ingestion and context-aware knowledge retrieval that learns and adapts to agent needs

## Goals
**Brief Description**: Create a complete intelligent knowledge management system that autonomously discovers, captures, organizes, and delivers knowledge to domain-expert agents based on their context and needs.

### Knowledge Ingestion Goals
- **Autonomous Knowledge Discovery**: Generate queries automatically based on system analysis
- **Query-Driven Efficiency**: Focus processing only on relevant information found through vector search
- **Context-Aware Extraction**: Expand context around relevant matches to ensure completeness
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve ingestion based on knowledge usage patterns

### Knowledge Retrieval Goals
- **Context-Aware Delivery**: Provide relevant knowledge based on agent's current task and context
- **Intelligent Query Understanding**: Interpret natural language queries and route to appropriate KOs
- **Proactive Knowledge Suggestions**: Anticipate knowledge needs before agents ask
- **Adaptive Personalization**: Learn individual agent preferences and optimize delivery

### Unified System Goals
- **Seamless Integration**: Ingestion and retrieval work together to optimize knowledge value
- **Zero Human Intervention**: Operate completely autonomously while maintaining high quality
- **Cross-Domain Intelligence**: Discover and deliver knowledge across different domains
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously improve both ingestion and retrieval effectiveness

## Non-Goals
**Brief Description**: Not replacing existing document processing, creating domain-specific templates, or providing end-user interfaces.

- Not eliminating the ability to process full documents when needed
- Not creating hardcoded query templates for specific domains
- Not replacing human expertise in knowledge validation
- Not implementing real-time processing during critical agent execution
- Not supporting non-text knowledge sources in initial implementation
- Not providing direct user interfaces (agents access through API)

## Proposed Solution
**Brief Description**: A unified intelligent knowledge management system with autonomous ingestion and context-aware retrieval, powered by LLMs and continuous learning.
