- **Current Gap**: Team has general equipment knowledge but lacks specific capabilities for non-standard patterns

**Material Properties - Optical Characteristics (Documentary + Topical)**
- **Why Needed**: High-Tg FR4 substrate has different optical properties than standard materials
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they can't configure lighting for optimal fiducial detection or set contrast thresholds for reliable pattern recognition
- **Current Gap**: Limited experience with this specific substrate material

**Optimization Techniques (Experiential + Procedural)**
- **Why Needed**: Team must optimize calibration for specific customer requirements and substrate
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they can't achieve ±0.1mm accuracy efficiently
- **Current Gap**: No systematic approach to parameter optimization for unique requirements

#### Knowledge Structure Decisions

**Topic: Vision System Calibration → Knowledge Structure Choices**

**Equipment Specifications (Relational Store)**
- **Why Relational**: Fast, reliable lookup during setup phase when team needs exact equipment capabilities

- **Query Pattern**: Structured queries like "equipment supporting ±0.1mm accuracy" or "cameras compatible with High-Tg FR4"

**Material Properties (Vector Store)**
- **Why Vector**: Similarity search for "materials like High-Tg FR4" when team encounters new substrate
- **Use Case Fit**: Team needs to find similar materials they've calibrated before and adapt those settings
- **Query Pattern**: "Find materials with similar optical properties" or "calibration settings for similar substrates"

**Calibration Standards (Semi-structured Store)**
- **Why Semi-structured**: Complex regulatory documents with hierarchical requirements that need flexible querying
- **Use Case Fit**: Team must validate against multiple standards and adapt requirements for customer specs
- **Query Pattern**: "Standards requiring ±0.1mm accuracy" or "validation procedures for medical devices"

**Procedure: Non-Standard Pattern Setup → Knowledge Structure Choices**

**Calibration Workflows (Semi-structured Store)**

- **Query Pattern**: "Calibration workflow for non-standard patterns" or "validation steps for ±0.1mm accuracy"

**Troubleshooting Procedures (Time Series Store)**
- **Why Time Series**: Track calibration attempts over time to identify patterns and optimize future setups
- **Use Case Fit**: Team needs to learn from failed attempts and avoid repeating unsuccessful approaches
- **Query Pattern**: "Previous calibration attempts for similar patterns" or "common failure modes for High-Tg FR4"

**Optimization Techniques (Vector Store)**
- **Why Vector**: Find similar optimization approaches quickly when team needs to adapt to new requirements
- **Use Case Fit**: Team needs to apply learned techniques from similar situations to achieve target accuracy
- **Query Pattern**: "Optimization techniques for ±0.1mm accuracy" or "parameter settings for non-standard patterns"
