# Use Case: IC Design FAE Customer Support

## Scenario Overview

**Company**: Advanced Microelectronics Inc. (AMI)  
**Role**: Field Application Engineer (FAE)  
**Challenge**: Responding to customer inquiry about power management IC implementation in medical device with unique requirements

## Customer Inquiry

**Customer**: MedTech Solutions  
**Application**: Battery-powered medical monitoring device  
**Inquiry**: "We're implementing your PMIC-2000 in our new patient monitoring system. We need guidance on power sequencing, thermal management, and compliance requirements for medical applications."

**Critical Constraints**:
- Medical device regulations (FDA, CE marking)
- Battery life requirements (72+ hours continuous operation)
- Harsh environment (temperature variations, EMI)
- Real-time reliability (patient safety critical)

## Current State (State-of-the-Art RAG System)

### System Baseline
- **RAG Implementation**: Advanced retrieval-augmented generation system
- **Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive document repository (datasheets, app notes, reference designs)
- **Retrieval**: Semantic search with dense embeddings
- **Generation**: Large language model with context injection
- **Interface**: Chat-based customer support system

### Current Process Issues
1. **Response Time**: 2-4 hours for comprehensive response (vs. customer expectation of same-day)
2. **Hallucination Risk**: System may generate plausible but incorrect information
3. **Context Selection**: Retrieves relevant documents but may miss critical details
4. **No Learning**: System doesn't improve from customer interactions or feedback
5. **Stateless**: Each interaction starts fresh, no memory of previous cases
6. **Limited Explainability**: Cannot trace decisions to specific knowledge sources

### RAG System Workflow
- **Query Processing**: Parse customer inquiry for key terms and intent
- **Document Retrieval**: Search knowledge base for relevant documents
- **Context Assembly**: Combine retrieved documents into context window
- **Response Generation**: Generate response using LLM with retrieved context
- **Response Delivery**: Provide generated response to customer

## KNOWS CORRAL Lifecycle Application

### 1. CURATE: Knowledge Requirements

**Input**: Use case (topic + procedure) + existing knowledge sources  
**Output**: Knowledge requirements + storage structure decisions + knowledge content

#### Topical Knowledge Needed - WHY These Are Critical

**Product Specifications (Prior + Topical)**
- **Why Needed**: FAE must quickly determine if PMIC-2000 meets customer's medical device requirements
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they can't validate product suitability, power sequencing capabilities, or thermal constraints for 72+ hour battery life
- **Current Gap**: RAG system has product docs but can't quickly validate against specific medical requirements

**Medical Device Regulations (Prior + Topical)**
- **Why Needed**: Customer's medical application requires FDA/CE compliance for patient safety
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they risk providing guidance that doesn't meet regulatory requirements
- **Current Gap**: RAG system may retrieve general information but miss critical regulatory details

**Battery Life Optimization (Experiential + Topical)**
- **Why Needed**: Customer requires 72+ hours continuous operation in harsh environment
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they can't provide specific guidance on power management for extended battery life
- **Current Gap**: RAG system has general power management info but lacks medical device-specific optimization

#### Procedural Knowledge Needed - WHY These Are Critical

**Implementation Workflows (Documentary + Procedural)**
- **Why Needed**: FAE must provide step-by-step guidance for medical device implementation
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they can't ensure proper power sequencing, thermal management, or compliance validation
- **Current Gap**: RAG system retrieves documents but can't compose systematic implementation guidance

**Customer Interaction Patterns (Experiential + Procedural)**
- **Why Needed**: Medical device customers have unique requirements and constraints that require specific questioning
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they miss critical requirements or provide incomplete guidance
- **Current Gap**: RAG system responds to questions but doesn't proactively identify missing requirements

**Troubleshooting Procedures (Experiential + Procedural)**
- **Why Needed**: Medical device implementations often encounter unique issues requiring specialized solutions
- **Use Case Impact**: Without this knowledge, they can't provide effective troubleshooting guidance for patient safety critical applications
- **Current Gap**: RAG system may suggest general solutions but lacks medical device-specific troubleshooting

#### Knowledge Structure Decisions

**Topic: Medical Device PMIC Implementation → Knowledge Structure Choices**

**Product Specifications (Relational Store)**
- **Why Relational**: Fast, reliable lookup when FAE needs exact product capabilities and limitations
- **Use Case Fit**: FAE must quickly answer "does PMIC-2000 support medical device requirements?" and "what are the power sequencing limits?"
- **Query Pattern**: Structured queries like "products supporting medical applications" or "PMIC-2000 thermal constraints"

**Medical Device Regulations (Semi-structured Store)**
- **Why Semi-structured**: Complex regulatory documents with hierarchical requirements and conditional logic
- **Use Case Fit**: FAE must navigate multiple regulations and adapt requirements for specific medical applications
- **Query Pattern**: "FDA requirements for patient monitoring devices" or "CE marking requirements for power management"

**Battery Life Optimization (Vector Store)**
- **Why Vector**: Similarity search for "implementations requiring 72+ hour battery life" when FAE encounters new requirements
- **Use Case Fit**: FAE needs to find similar customer implementations and adapt those solutions
- **Query Pattern**: "Find implementations with similar battery life requirements" or "power management techniques for harsh environments"

**Procedure: Customer Support for Medical Applications → Knowledge Structure Choices**

**Implementation Workflows (Semi-structured Store)**
- **Why Semi-structured**: Workflows need conditional logic based on customer requirements and regulatory constraints
- **Use Case Fit**: FAE needs step-by-step guidance that adapts to specific customer constraints and medical requirements
- **Query Pattern**: "Implementation workflow for medical devices" or "compliance checklist for FDA approval"

**Customer Interaction Patterns (Vector Store)**
- **Why Vector**: Find similar customer situations quickly to apply proven questioning and response strategies
- **Use Case Fit**: FAE needs to identify patterns in medical device customer requirements and adapt interaction strategies
- **Query Pattern**: "Similar medical device customer inquiries" or "effective questioning strategies for medical applications"

**Troubleshooting Procedures (Time Series Store)**
- **Why Time Series**: Track customer implementation progress and identify patterns in issues and solutions over time
- **Use Case Fit**: FAE needs to learn from previous customer implementations and predict potential issues
- **Query Pattern**: "Previous medical device implementation issues" or "common troubleshooting patterns for PMIC-2000"

#### Knowledge Sources
- **Human**: Engineering team, previous customers, regulatory experts
- **Machine**: Customer support logs, implementation success data, performance metrics
