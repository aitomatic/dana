# KNOWS Architecture Design

*Knowledge Organization and Workflow Structures*

## Core Philosophy

KNOWS transforms agents from impressive demos into intelligent, learning, trustworthy systems by providing structured, contextual, and evolving knowledge. The framework is built on the principle that knowledge is only valuable if it helps the agent achieve its goal better, faster, and cheaper.

## Architecture Overview

KNOWS implements the CORRAL lifecycle for systematic domain knowledge management:

- **Curate**: Systematic knowledge acquisition from diverse sources, including human interviews and synthesis
- **Organize**: Structured representation and categorization  
- **Retrieve**: Context-aware knowledge access and selection
- **Reason**: Inference and decision-making processes
- **Act**: Knowledge application to real-world tasks
- **Learn**: Feedback integration and knowledge refinement

---

## 1. CURATE: Knowledge Categorization and Requirements

### Knowledge Dimensions (P-T Classification)

KNOWS categorizes knowledge along two essential dimensions that work together to create a complete picture of what the agent knows and how to use it.

#### Phase (P) - When knowledge became real
- **Prior**: Pre-existing expertise and domain knowledge
- **Documentary**: Procedures, manuals, documented practices
- **Experiential**: Knowledge learned through real-world interaction

#### Type (T) - What kind of knowledge
- **Topical**: Facts, rules, understanding (the "what")
- **Procedural**: Workflows, methods, processes (the "how")

### Use Case → Knowledge Architecture Mapping

KNOWS provides a systematic methodology to map use case requirements to knowledge structures:

#### Use Case Dimensions
- **Topic**: What domain/subject we're working in
- **Procedure**: What processes/workflows we need to execute

#### Direct Mapping Methodology
```
Use Case → Knowledge Requirements
Topic    → Topical Knowledge (T)
Procedure → Procedural Knowledge (T)

Then for each:
Topic/Procedure → Prior + Documentary + Experiential (P)
```

#### Example: Manufacturing Quality Control
**Use Case:**
- **Topic**: Quality standards, defect patterns, equipment specs
- **Procedure**: Inspection workflows, escalation processes, corrective actions

**Knowledge Architecture:**
- **Topic + Prior**: Industry standards, equipment specifications
- **Topic + Documentary**: Quality manuals, defect catalogs  
- **Topic + Experiential**: Learned defect patterns, performance trends
- **Procedure + Prior**: Core inspection methods, compliance procedures
- **Procedure + Documentary**: SOPs, workflow documentation
- **Procedure + Experiential**: Optimized workflows, learned best practices

### Knowledge Attributes (KISS Metadata)

#### Core Attributes
- **Confidence**: Reliability score (0-1)
- **Source Type**: Human/Machine/Document/Generated/Computed
- **Source Authority**: Credibility of the source (0-1)
- **Scope**: Applicable domain/context
- **Status**: raw → validated → archived
- **Usage Count**: How often accessed
- **Timestamps**: Created, last accessed, last updated

#### Operational Attributes
- **Goal Alignment**: Relevance to specific objectives
- **Conflict Resolution**: Priority when conflicting with other knowledge
- **Temporal Validity**: Time-based relevance
- **Access Patterns**: How knowledge is typically retrieved

---

## 2. ORGANIZE: Knowledge Storage and Structure

### Memory Architecture

#### Short-Term Memory (M-ST)
- **Purpose**: Active task context and scratchpad
- **Content**: Current task state, intermediate results, to-do items
- **Lifecycle**: Session-based, can be promoted to long-term

#### Long-Term Memory (M-LT)
- **Purpose**: Learned and validated knowledge
- **Content**: Promoted experiential knowledge, validated patterns
- **Lifecycle**: Persistent, evolves through use

#### Permanent Memory (M-P)
- **Purpose**: Core system knowledge and priors
- **Content**: Domain fundamentals, immutable rules
- **Lifecycle**: Static, rarely changes

### Knowledge Organizations

Four specialized storage systems for different data types, chosen based on use case requirements:

#### Relational Store
- **Purpose**: Facts, rules, reference data
- **Best for**: Structured queries, validation rules
- **Example**: Equipment specifications, compliance requirements

#### Semi-structured Store
- **Purpose**: Workflows, procedures, decision trees
- **Best for**: Step-by-step processes, SOPs
- **Example**: Troubleshooting guides, escalation paths

#### Vector Store
- **Purpose**: Similarity search, pattern recognition
- **Best for**: Finding analogous situations
- **Example**: Historical cases, anomaly detection

#### Time Series Store
- **Purpose**: Temporal patterns, trends, sequences
- **Best for**: Performance tracking, degradation curves
- **Example**: Process history, maintenance cycles

## 3. RETRIEVE: Knowledge Access and Selection

### Context Window Optimization

1. **Goal Analysis**: Determine current task and subgoals
2. **Knowledge Selection**: Filter by relevance, confidence, scope
3. **Composition**: Assemble minimal, goal-relevant context
4. **Injection**: Provide structured knowledge to agent
5. **Feedback**: Track usage and outcomes

### Retrieval Strategies

#### Goal-Driven Filtering
- Filter knowledge by alignment with current objectives
- Prioritize knowledge with high goal relevance scores
- Exclude knowledge outside current scope

#### Relevance Ranking
- Use semantic similarity for topical knowledge
- Apply workflow matching for procedural knowledge
- Consider phase-appropriate knowledge selection

#### Confidence-Based Prioritization
- Prefer high-confidence knowledge for critical decisions
- Use lower-confidence knowledge for exploration
- Balance confidence with relevance

## 4. REASON: Knowledge Composition and Inference

### Structured Knowledge Composition

#### Knowledge Units (KUnits)
- Atomic pieces of knowledge with P-T classification
- Metadata for confidence, scope, source, and relationships
- Composable for complex reasoning tasks

#### Context Injection
- Structured knowledge provided to LLM context
- Optimized for token efficiency and relevance
- Maintains traceability of knowledge sources

#### Reasoning Patterns
- Topical knowledge for factual reasoning
- Procedural knowledge for action planning
- Experiential knowledge for pattern recognition

### Uncertainty Handling

#### Confidence Assessment
- Track confidence levels for all knowledge
- Propagate uncertainty through reasoning chains
- Provide clear uncertainty indicators to agents

#### Conflict Resolution
- Detect conflicting knowledge from different sources
- Apply resolution strategies based on authority and confidence
- Maintain audit trail of resolution decisions

---

## 5. ACT: Knowledge Application and Execution

### Agent Integration

#### Knowledge-Driven Actions
- Agents use retrieved knowledge to perform tasks
- Actions are traceable to specific knowledge sources
- Performance metrics are collected for learning

#### Task Performance Tracking
- Monitor how effectively knowledge is applied
- Track success rates and response times
- Identify knowledge gaps and improvement opportunities

#### Action Validation
- Verify that actions align with knowledge recommendations
- Check for consistency with procedural knowledge
- Validate outcomes against expected results

---

## 6. LEARN: Feedback Integration and Knowledge Evolution

### Continuous Learning Loop

1. **Action**: Agent uses knowledge to perform task
2. **Observation**: Capture outcomes and feedback
3. **Evaluation**: Assess knowledge effectiveness
4. **Update**: Adjust confidence, usage counts, status
5. **Promotion**: Elevate successful patterns

### Knowledge Lifecycle Management

#### Feedback Processing
- Analyze task outcomes and user feedback
- Identify knowledge that performed well or poorly
- Update confidence scores based on performance

#### Knowledge Promotion
- Move successful experiential knowledge to documentary
- Promote validated patterns to permanent knowledge
- Archive obsolete or low-performing knowledge

#### Pattern Recognition
- Identify recurring successful patterns
- Detect knowledge that consistently performs well
- Create new knowledge from learned insights
