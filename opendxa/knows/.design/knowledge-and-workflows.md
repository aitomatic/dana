       with ContextManager() as ctx:
           # Add problem context
           ctx.add_knowledge(query_knowledge(problem))
           
           # Add environmental context
           ctx.add_iot_data(get_iot_sensors(problem.equipment_id))
           ctx.add_system_state(get_system_observables())
           ctx.add_environment(env_data)
           ctx.add_location(get_location_context())
           
           # Perform reasoning with full context
           analysis = reason("Analyze problem", 
                           {"problem": problem, "context": ctx.get_context()})
       return analysis
   ```

#### 5. Workflow-KO Interaction Patterns

The workflow-KO interaction patterns define how domain-specific workflows retrieve and utilize knowledge from different knowledge organizations. These patterns ensure efficient knowledge access while maintaining context awareness and type safety.

- **Query-Based Interaction**
  This pattern involves direct, sequential queries to different knowledge organizations, combining their results for comprehensive analysis. It's most suitable when:
  - Different types of knowledge are needed in a specific order
  - Query results from one KO influence subsequent queries
  - Complex analysis requires multiple knowledge sources

  Example workflow for semiconductor issue analysis:
  ```dana
  def analyze_semiconductor_issue(issue_data: dict) -> str:
      # Query vector store for similar issues
      similar_cases = query_vector_store(
          embedding=issue_data["symptoms"],
          limit=5
      )
      
      # Query time series for historical patterns
      historical_data = query_time_series(
          metric="defect_rate",
          time_range="last_30_days"
      )
      
      # Query semi-structured store for related procedures
      procedures = query_semi_structured(
          filters={"category": "semiconductor", "type": "troubleshooting"}
      )
      
      # Combine knowledge for analysis
      return analyze_with_context(
          current_issue=issue_data,
          similar_cases=similar_cases,
          history=historical_data,
          procedures=procedures
      )
  ```

- **Pipeline-Based Interaction**
  This pattern leverages Dana's pipeline composition to create reusable knowledge retrieval workflows. It's ideal for:
  - Creating modular, reusable knowledge retrieval steps
  - Combining multiple knowledge sources in a flexible way
  - Supporting different query sequences for different use cases

  Example of a composable knowledge retrieval pipeline:
  ```dana
  # Define knowledge retrieval steps
  def get_similar_cases(data: dict) -> list:
      return query_vector_store(data["symptoms"])
  
  def get_historical_data(data: dict) -> dict:
      return query_time_series(data["metrics"])
  
  def get_procedures(data: dict) -> list:
      return query_semi_structured(data["filters"])
  
  # Compose workflow pipeline
  analysis_pipeline = (
      get_similar_cases |
      get_historical_data |
      get_procedures |
      analyze_with_context
  )
  ```

- **Context-Aware Interaction**
  This pattern uses the ContextManager to maintain state and guide knowledge retrieval based on the current problem context. It's particularly useful for:
  - Complex problems requiring multiple reasoning steps
  - Maintaining conversation history and context
  - Guiding knowledge retrieval based on previous interactions

  Example of context-aware problem solving:
  ```dana
  def solve_problem(problem: str, context: dict) -> str:
      with ContextManager() as ctx:
          # Add problem context
          ctx.add_problem(problem)
          
          # Query relevant knowledge
          knowledge = query_knowledge(
              problem=problem,
              context=ctx.get_context()
          )
          
          # Add knowledge to context
          ctx.add_knowledge(knowledge)
          
          # Perform reasoning
          solution = reason(
              "Solve problem",
              {"problem": problem, "context": ctx.get_context()}
          )
          
          return solution
  ```

- **Interaction Patterns**:
  The framework supports four main patterns for workflow-KO interaction, each suited for different scenarios:

  1. **Direct Query**: Simple, sequential queries to specific KOs when the knowledge retrieval path is well-defined
  2. **Pipeline Query**: Composable, reusable query sequences for flexible knowledge retrieval workflows
  3. **Context-Enhanced Query**: Stateful queries that leverage context to guide knowledge retrieval
  4. **Hybrid Query**: Combinations of the above patterns for complex problem-solving scenarios

- **Query Optimization**:
  To ensure efficient knowledge retrieval, the framework implements several optimization strategies:

  - Parallel query execution where possible to reduce latency
  - Caching of frequent queries to improve response time
  - Query result aggregation to minimize data transfer
  - Context-aware query routing to optimize knowledge retrieval paths

        }
        return backends[config.backend](**config.params)
    
    def store_knowledge(self, knowledge_id: str, content: str, metadata: dict):
        """Store knowledge with vector embedding"""
        document = Document(text=content, metadata=metadata, doc_id=knowledge_id)
        self.index.insert(document)
    
    def find_similar(self, query: str, limit: int, filters: dict = None) -> list[dict]:
        """Find similar knowledge items"""
        retriever = self.index.as_retriever(
            similarity_top_k=limit,
            filters=MetadataFilters.from_dict(filters) if filters else None
        )
        return retriever.retrieve(query)
```
