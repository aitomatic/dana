# Conversation Summary: KNOWS Framework Design Session

**Date**: 2024-03-19  
**Session Focus**: Design of OpenDXA KNOWS (Knowledge Organizations and Workflow System) Framework  
**Participants**: User (Domain Expert), AI Assistant (Design Collaborator)

## Session Overview

This session focused on designing the KNOWS subsystem for OpenDXA, a framework for building domain-expert multi-agent systems. The conversation progressed from high-level architecture discussion to detailed use case implementation, following the 3D (Design-Driven Development) methodology.

## Key Design Decisions Made

### 1. Core Architecture Requirements
- **Dana Language Constraint**: All workflows MUST be encoded in Dana language for consistent state management, type safety, and DXA framework integration
- **Technology Stack Consolidation**: 
  - PostgreSQL + pgvector (instead of Milvus) for vector storage
  - PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (instead of InfluxDB) for time series
  - Redis (instead of MongoDB) for semi-structured data
- **Explicit ContextManager**: Decision to use explicit ContextManager for better control over complex workflows

### 2. Environmental Context Integration
- **Major Insight**: Environmental context sources (IoT, observables, measurements, location) are critical for real-world problem solving
- **Four Context Categories**:
  1. IoT Sensors (real-time equipment data)
  2. System State Observables (monitoring, logs, alerts)
  3. Environmental Conditions (physical, network, infrastructure)
  4. Location Context (geographic, organizational, permissions)

### 3. RoCA (Root of Cause Analysis) Specifics
- **Terminology**: Use "RoCA" (Root of Cause Analysis) not "RCA" 
- **SPC/FDC Integration**: Explicit integration with Statistical Process Control and Fault Detection & Classification systems
- **Engineering Roles**: Support for Process, Facilities, Yield, and Device Engineers
- **Known vs Unknown Root Causes**: Framework handles both pattern-matched cases and novel investigative scenarios
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: AI assists but humans retain decision-making authority

## Documents Created

### 1. Main Framework Design (`knowledge-and-workflows.md`)
- **Status**: Complete design phase
- **Key Sections**: 
  - System architecture with environmental context
  - Workflow-KO interaction patterns
  - Context management with environmental data integration
  - Implementation phases (3D methodology)

### 2. RIE RoCA Use Case (`rie-roca-workflow.md`)
- **Status**: Complete design phase
- **Key Sections**:
  - Role-specific workflows for each engineering discipline
  - Known vs unknown root cause classification framework
  - Human-AI collaboration patterns
  - SPC/FDC integration examples
  - Mermaid diagrams optimized for readability

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Knowledge Organizations (KOs)
1. **Semi-structured Store** (Redis): Procedures, rules, specifications
2. **Vector Store** (PostgreSQL + pgvector): Historical cases, embeddings
3. **Time Series Store** (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB): Process data, trends
4. **Relational Store** (PostgreSQL): Equipment configurations, parameters

### Workflow-KO Interaction Patterns
1. **Query-Based Interaction**: Direct sequential queries to different KOs
2. **Pipeline-Based Interaction**: Composable workflows using Dana's pipeline features
3. **Context-Aware Interaction**: ContextManager-guided knowledge retrieval
4. **Hybrid Query**: Combinations of above patterns

### Environmental Context Integration
- **Architecture Change**: Added dedicated "Environmental Context" subgraph in all diagrams
- **ContextManager Enhancement**: Now orchestrates both knowledge and environmental data
- **Real-world Problem Solving**: Emphasis on gathering context from external environment

## Industry Context

### Target Markets
- **Primary**: Industrial (semiconductor manufacturing)
- **Secondary**: Financial (credit analysis, risk assessment)

### Semiconductor Use Cases
- **RIE Process**: Reactive Ion Etching root cause analysis
- **Engineering Roles**: Process, Facilities, Yield, Device engineers
- **Systems Integration**: SPC, FDC, MES, IoT sensors
- **Workflow Types**: Known pattern matching, unknown cause investigation

## Key Insights from Session

### 1. Environmental Context is Critical
- Knowledge alone is insufficient for real-world problem solving
- Environmental data (IoT, system state, conditions, location) must be integrated
- ContextManager serves as the orchestration point for all context sources

### 2. Human-AI Collaboration is Essential
- AI provides analysis and recommendations
- Humans retain decision-making authority
- Different interaction patterns needed (AI-initiated, human-initiated, collaborative)

### 3. Domain Expertise Drives Design
- Engineering roles have distinct workflows and data needs
- Known vs unknown root causes require different handling strategies
- Integration with existing systems (SPC/FDC) is mandatory

### 4. Dana Language Advantages
- Pipeline composition for workflow modularity
- Explicit scoping for state management
- Type safety for reliable operations
- Built-in reasoning capabilities
