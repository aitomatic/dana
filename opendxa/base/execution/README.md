# Base Execution Module (`opendxa.base.execution`)

This module provides the foundational abstract classes and interfaces for the execution framework within OpenDXA.

It defines the core concepts like `BaseExecutor`, `ExecutionContext`, `ExecutionGraph`, and `ExecutionSignal` that are used and extended by concrete execution implementations (like Planning, Reasoning, Pipelines).

For detailed explanations of the Base Execution Framework concepts, interfaces, and patterns, please refer to the **[Base Execution Framework Concepts Documentation](../../../docs/details/base_execution.md)**.

## Key Components

- **`BaseExecutor`**: Abstract base class for all execution components.
- **`ExecutionContext`**: Holds state and resources during an execution run.
- **`ExecutionGraph`**: Base structure for defining execution flows.
- **`ExecutionSignal`**: Standardized structure for communication during execution.
- **Supporting Types**: Enums and dataclasses for nodes, edges, results, etc.
