## Design Process Context

**This implementation plan evolved through comprehensive design discussions addressing critical architectural and business model challenges:**

### **Business Model Evolution**
- **Initial Concept**: Framework + Knowledge API service
- **Final Design**: Complete agent delivery service (API provides agent code + matching knowledge + interfaces)
- **Key Insight**: Eliminates knowledge-structure mismatch by co-delivering agent code with optimized knowledge format
- **Business Impact**: Transforms value proposition from "knowledge access" to "complete domain expertise delivery"

### **Critical Problems Identified and Solved**
1. **Resource Heterogeneity Challenge**: Same domain expertise used with different user environments
   - **Problem**: SECS/GEM vs CSV files, Oracle vs PostgreSQL, Slack vs Teams notifications
   - **Solution**: Layered architecture with core intelligence (API) + environment adapters (user-provided)
   - **Implementation**: Standardized interfaces (DataSource, Output, Alert) with user adapter implementations

2. **Knowledge-Structure Mismatch Crisis**: Client KNOWS structure vs API knowledge format incompatibility  
   - **Problem**: User KNOWS structures evolve fast, API knowledge schemas evolve slowly
   - **Solution**: API delivers complete agent packages (code + knowledge + interfaces) pre-optimized
   - **Implementation**: Agent code and knowledge structure co-designed and version-managed together

3. **Multiple Storage Type Optimization**: Different domains need different storage for optimal performance
   - **Problem**: One-size-fits-all knowledge storage suboptimal for domain intelligence quality
   - **Solution**: Vector for defects, graph for processes, RDBMS for specs, documents for procedures
   - **Implementation**: Single API interface with backend routing based on domain and query type

### **Design Constraints from Business Model**
- **Hybrid Architecture Requirement**: Must support API + local/offline to avoid vendor lock-in
- **Value Demonstration Constraint**: API intelligence must justify ongoing costs vs local knowledge
- **Market Positioning**: Focus on high-value industrial domains (semiconductor, manufacturing, finance)
- **Competitive Response**: Create sustainable advantage through synthetic knowledge that's hard to replicate

### **KNOWS Integration Strategy**
- **Deployment Preference**: Client-side KNOWS for business model alignment (API usage tracking)
- **Population Strategy**: API-driven knowledge with smart caching and offline fallback
- **Storage Flexibility**: Support multiple backends while maintaining consistent agent interface
- **Workflow Adaptability**: Communication primitives enable runtime workflow pattern configuration

### **Quality and Demo Requirements**
- **Testing Standard**: >95% coverage, zero failures allowed between phases
- **Demo Goal**: Amazing MVP showcasing 6 weeks → 2 days transformation with real business value
- **Success Metrics**: <30s execution, real domain intelligence, multi-agent coordination, clear ROI
- **Business Validation**: Must prove API monetization model and competitive advantage

### **Quick Reference for Implementation**

**Core Architecture Decisions:**
- **Extend struct system** (don't create parallel agent system) → reuse existing infrastructure
- **Agent code + knowledge delivery** (not raw knowledge) → eliminate format mismatch
- **Layered agent architecture** (core intelligence + user adapters) → solve resource heterogeneity
- **Multiple storage backends** (vector/graph/RDBMS/docs) → optimize per domain
- **Communication primitives** (not hardcoded patterns) → enable KNOWS workflow flexibility

**Implementation Sequence Logic:**
- **Phase 1-2**: Core agent functionality + API integration foundation
- **Phase 3-4**: Multi-agent coordination + GMA orchestration pattern
- **Phase 5-6**: KNOWS integration + production business model validation
- **Each Phase**: Must build demo component toward final amazing MVP showcase

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Zero Failures**: 100% test pass rate required to advance phases
- **>95% Coverage**: Comprehensive testing prevents regressions
- **Demo-Driven**: Every phase contributes to semiconductor fab optimization showcase
- **Business Value**: Must prove 6 weeks → 2 days transformation with clear ROI

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **DECISION**: Extend existing struct system rather than create parallel agent system
  - **Rationale**: Reuses proven infrastructure, maintains consistency, reduces complexity
  - **Impact**: Faster development, better maintainability, consistent behavior

- **DECISION**: Use existing FunctionRegistry for method dispatch
  - **Rationale**: Proven polymorphic dispatch system, no new infrastructure needed
  - **Impact**: Leverages existing patterns, enables method overrides, maintains simplicity

- **DECISION**: Implement GMA (General Management Agent) as dominant coordination pattern
  - **Rationale**: Matches real-world management structures, addresses most common use cases
  - **Impact**: Clear mental model for users, scalable coordination, reusable pattern

- **DECISION**: Communication primitives instead of hardcoded patterns
  - **Rationale**: Supports KNOWS runtime workflow requirements, enables flexibility
  - **Impact**: Future-proof design, supports diverse coordination needs, enables runtime adaptation

### Implementation Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Consider memory cleanup for long-running agent systems
- **Error Recovery**: Implement robust error handling for communication failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Profile memory system for large knowledge bases
- **Security**: Validate agent communication security in multi-tenant scenarios
