# HVAC Control with POET: Building Management Excellence

## Use Case Overview

**Industry**: Building Management Systems  
**Problem**: HVAC systems require constant optimization to balance energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and equipment longevity  
**POET Value**: Transform basic control logic into self-optimizing building management with minimal engineering effort

## Business Context

A modern office building has:
- **40+ zones** requiring independent temperature control
- **Variable occupancy** throughout day/week/season
- **Energy cost optimization** pressure (30% of total building costs)
- **Comfort requirements** (68-76°F range, <10% complaints)
- **Equipment protection** (prevent damage from improper operation)
- **Regulatory compliance** (energy efficiency standards)

## Traditional HVAC Control Challenges

### Before POET Implementation:
```python
# Traditional brittle HVAC control
def control_hvac_zone(current_temp: float, setpoint: float, occupancy: bool) -> dict:
    # Hard-coded control logic that doesn't adapt
    if occupancy:
        if current_temp < setpoint - 2:
            return {"heating": 100, "cooling": 0}  # Max heating
        elif current_temp > setpoint + 2:
            return {"heating": 0, "cooling": 100}  # Max cooling
        else:
            return {"heating": 0, "cooling": 0}    # Off
    else:
        # Energy saving mode - but fixed parameters
        if current_temp < setpoint - 5:
            return {"heating": 50, "cooling": 0}
        elif current_temp > setpoint + 5:
            return {"heating": 0, "cooling": 50}
        else:
            return {"heating": 0, "cooling": 0}

# Problems:
# - Fixed temperature bands don't adapt to weather, season, or equipment
# - No learning from energy usage patterns  
# - Ignores thermal mass, equipment efficiency, occupancy patterns
# - No equipment wear optimization
# - Manual parameter tuning required for each zone
```

**Typical Results:**
- **Energy Waste**: 25-40% above optimal due to fixed setpoints
- **Comfort Issues**: 15-20% occupant complaints from overshooting
- **Equipment Wear**: Premature failure from aggressive cycling
- **Manual Tuning**: Constant adjustments needed for seasonal changes

## POET Solution: Intelligent Building Control

### What the Engineer Writes (Simple Business Logic)
```python
from opendxa.common.poet.executor import poet
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict

@dataclass
class HVACCommand:
    heating_output: float  # 0-100%
    cooling_output: float  # 0-100%
    fan_speed: float      # 0-100%
    reason: str

@poet(
    domain="building_management",  # Automatic HVAC optimization
    learning="on"                  # Continuous learning from patterns
)
def control_hvac_zone(
    current_temp: float,
    setpoint: float, 
    occupancy: bool,
    outdoor_temp: float,
    zone_id: str
) -> HVACCommand:
    """
    Zone HVAC control with POET intelligent optimization.
    
    Simple thermal control logic - POET handles equipment optimization,
    learning, weather adaptation, and energy efficiency automatically.
    """
    
    # Simple temperature error calculation
    temp_error = current_temp - setpoint
    
    # Basic occupancy adjustment
    comfort_band = 1.0 if occupancy else 3.0  # Tighter control when occupied
    
    # Simple control logic (POET will optimize these parameters)
    if abs(temp_error) <= comfort_band:
        # Within comfort zone
        return HVACCommand(0, 0, 20, "Maintaining temperature")
    
    elif temp_error < -comfort_band:
        # Too cold - need heating
        heating_level = min(100, abs(temp_error) * 25)  # Simple proportional
        return HVACCommand(heating_level, 0, 60, "Heating to setpoint")
    
    else:
        # Too hot - need cooling  
        cooling_level = min(100, temp_error * 25)  # Simple proportional
        return HVACCommand(0, cooling_level, 60, "Cooling to setpoint")
```

### What POET Runtime Provides Automatically (No Code Written)

#### **Perceive Stage (Automatic Environmental Intelligence)**
```python
# POET automatically handles:
# ✅ Weather pattern integration (learns seasonal HVAC load patterns)
# ✅ Occupancy prediction (anticipates temperature needs from schedules)
# ✅ Equipment health monitoring (detects degraded performance)
# ✅ Energy rate optimization (schedules pre-cooling during low-rate periods)
# ✅ Thermal mass learning (understands building heat retention characteristics)
# ✅ Sensor fault detection (identifies and compensates for bad readings)

# Example automatic enhancements applied by POET:
enhanced_inputs = {
    "current_temp": 72.3,
    "setpoint": 74.0,
    "occupancy": True,
    "outdoor_temp": 85.5,
    
    # POET automatically adds context:
    "weather_forecast": {"peak_temp": 89, "duration_hours": 4},
    "thermal_mass_factor": 0.85,  # Building retains 85% heat for 2 hours
    "equipment_efficiency": {"heating": 0.92, "cooling": 0.88},
    "energy_rate_schedule": {"current": 0.12, "peak_starts_in": 45},
    "predicted_occupancy": {"next_2_hours": [0.8, 0.3]},  # 80% then 30%
    "zone_thermal_model": learned_zone_characteristics[zone_id]
}
```

#### **Enforce Stage (Automatic Equipment Protection & Efficiency)**
```python
# POET automatically provides:
# ✅ Equipment cycling protection (prevents damage from short cycles)
# ✅ Capacity limit enforcement (prevents equipment overload)
# ✅ Energy consumption validation (ensures commands are efficient)
# ✅ Comfort guarantee (validates commands won't cause comfort issues)
# ✅ Safety interlocks (prevents simultaneous heating/cooling)
# ✅ Maintenance optimization (balances performance with equipment life)

# Example automatic validation and adjustment:
{
    "original_command": {"heating": 75, "cooling": 0, "fan": 60},
    "poet_optimized_command": {
        "heating_output": 65,      # Reduced to extend equipment life
        "cooling_output": 0,
        "fan_speed": 45,           # Optimized for noise and energy
        "staging_delay": 120,      # Wait 2 min since last cycle
        "reason": "Efficient heating with equipment protection"
    },
    "equipment_protection": {
        "min_cycle_time_remaining": 120,
        "compressor_starts_today": 12,  # Under 15/day limit
        "filter_condition": "good"
    },
    "energy_optimization": {
        "estimated_consumption_kwh": 3.2,
        "cost_this_hour": "$0.38",
        "efficiency_score": 0.91
    }
}
```

#### **Train Stage (Automatic Performance Learning)**
```python
# POET automatically learns and optimizes:
# ✅ Optimal control parameters for each zone's thermal characteristics
# ✅ Occupancy pattern recognition for proactive temperature management
# ✅ Weather response optimization (pre-cooling strategies)
# ✅ Equipment efficiency tracking and compensation
# ✅ Energy cost minimization while maintaining comfort
# ✅ Seasonal adaptation (winter vs summer strategies)

# Example learning progression over time:
learning_evolution = {
    "week_1": {
        "comfort_band": 1.0,        # Engineer's original setting
        "proportional_gain": 25,    # Engineer's original setting
        "energy_efficiency": 0.72,  # Baseline
        "comfort_complaints": 0.12   # 12% complaint rate
    },
    "month_3": {
        "comfort_band": 0.8,        # POET learned tighter control works better
        "proportional_gain": 18,    # POET learned gentler control is more efficient
        "pre_cooling_lead": 45,     # POET learned to pre-cool 45min before peak occupancy
        "thermal_mass_factor": 0.85, # POET learned building's heat retention
        "energy_efficiency": 0.89,  # 17% improvement
        "comfort_complaints": 0.03   # 75% reduction in complaints
    },
    "year_1": {
        "seasonal_strategies": {
            "winter": {"emphasis": "humidity_control", "setback": 4.0},
            "summer": {"emphasis": "pre_cooling", "setback": 2.5}
        },
        "occupancy_prediction": {"accuracy": 0.94},
        "weather_adaptation": {"lead_time_hours": 6},

        "comfort_complaints": 0.01   # 92% reduction
    }
}
```

## Real-World HVAC Domain Intelligence

### **Building Management Domain Profile**

    "automatic_perceive_handlers": {
        "temperature": TemperatureSensorProcessor,    # Handles sensor drift, outliers

```

## Concrete Learning Examples

### **Learning in Action: Zone Optimization**
```python
# MONTH 1: Engineer deploys simple control function
zone_data = {
    "current_temp": 73.0, "setpoint": 72.0, "occupancy": True, 
    "outdoor_temp": 85.0, "zone_id": "west_conference"
}

# Original naive calculation:
temp_error = 73.0 - 72.0  # +1.0°F too warm
comfort_band = 1.0
cooling_level = min(100, 1.0 * 25) = 25%  # 25% cooling

# POET Result: Basic cooling command
original_command = HVACCommand(0, 25, 60, "Cooling to setpoint")

# MONTH 6: After learning from 1000+ control cycles
# POET learned through actual building performance:
# - This west zone gets afternoon sun load requiring 35% more cooling
# - Pre-cooling at 11 AM prevents afternoon overshoot
# - This zone's thermal mass requires 20min lead time
# - Equipment performs best with staged operation rather than immediate 25%

# POET runtime now calculates optimal response:
learned_adjustments = {
    "solar_load_factor": 1.35,      # 35% more load due to west exposure
    "thermal_lag_compensation": 20,  # 20 minute thermal lag learned
    "equipment_staging": "gradual",  # Staged operation more efficient
    "pre_cooling_strategy": True     # Pre-cool to avoid peak load
}

# Same engineer function, but POET applies learned optimizations:
enhanced_cooling_level = min(100, 1.0 * 25 * 1.35) = 34%  # Solar load adjustment
staged_command = {"initial": 15, "ramp_to": 34, "duration": 10}  # Staged approach

# POET Result: Optimized cooling with learned parameters
optimized_command = HVACCommand(0, 34, 50, "Solar-aware staged cooling")

# Performance Impact:
# - 18% less energy consumption (staged operation more efficient)
# - 40% fewer comfort complaints (pro-active temperature control)
# - 25% longer equipment life (gentler operation reduces wear)
```

### **Weather Learning Example**
```python
# SEASONAL LEARNING: POET adapts to weather patterns

# SUMMER STRATEGY (learned from June-August data):
summer_optimizations = {
    "pre_cooling": {
        "start_time": "06:00",      # Pre-cool during low energy rates
        "target_temp": 70,          # 2°F below setpoint
        "outdoor_trigger": 85       # Start when forecast shows 85°F+
    },
    "thermal_mass_utilization": {
        "charging_hours": [6, 7, 8, 9],      # Charge thermal mass early
        "discharging_hours": [14, 15, 16],    # Coast through peak heat
        "mass_capacity": 4.2        # Building holds 4.2°F temperature swing
    },
    "equipment_staging": {
        "ramp_rate": 5,             # 5% per minute max increase
        "peak_shaving": True,       # Reduce load during utility peak hours
        "efficiency_priority": 0.9   # Prioritize efficiency over speed
    }
}

# WINTER STRATEGY (learned from December-February data):
winter_optimizations = {
    "morning_warmup": {
        "start_time": "05:30",      # Early warmup for thermal mass
        "ramp_strategy": "aggressive", # Fast warmup acceptable in winter
        "humidity_control": True     # Winter requires humidity management
    },
    "night_setback": {
        "setback_temp": 65,         # Deeper setback than summer (4°F vs 2°F)
        "recovery_time": 90,        # Allow 90min for morning recovery
        "outdoor_compensation": True # Adjust based on outdoor temperature
    }
}

# POET automatically switches strategies based on calendar and weather forecast
# Engineer's function never changes, but behavior adapts seasonally
```

## Usage Examples

### **Simple Function Call (Enhanced Automatically)**
```python
# Engineer calls the function normally - POET intelligence applied automatically
result = control_hvac_zone(
    current_temp=73.5,
    setpoint=72.0,
    occupancy=True,
    outdoor_temp=88.0,
    zone_id="zone_west_203"
)

# Returns optimized command:
# HVACCommand(
#     heating_output=0, 
#     cooling_output=42,  # Optimized for solar load + pre-cooling strategy
#     fan_speed=55,       # Optimized for energy and acoustics
#     reason="Proactive cooling with solar compensation"
# )
```

### **Multi-Zone Coordination (POET Handles Automatically)**
```python
# POET automatically coordinates multiple zones for building-wide efficiency
zones = ["zone_north_1", "zone_south_2", "zone_west_3", "zone_east_4"]

for zone_id in zones:
    zone_data = get_zone_data(zone_id)
    command = control_hvac_zone(**zone_data)
    
    # POET automatically:
    # - Coordinates timing to avoid peak electrical demand
    # - Balances loads across zones for equipment efficiency
    # - Shares thermal energy between zones when beneficial
    # - Optimizes whole-building energy consumption
```

## Key POET Design Principles Demonstrated

### **1. Minimal Code, Maximum Intelligence**
- **6 lines** of business logic vs **500+ lines** for traditional adaptive HVAC
- Engineer focuses on **temperature control algorithm**, POET handles optimization
- **No custom weather integration, learning algorithms, or equipment protection code needed**

### **2. Domain Intelligence Built-In**
- `domain="building_management"` provides automatic HVAC capabilities
- Pre-built understanding of thermal systems, equipment constraints, energy optimization
- **No need to research HVAC control theory, PID tuning, or energy management**

### **3. Automatic Learning Without HVAC Expertise**
- System improves from **72% to 94%** energy efficiency without engineer involvement
- **Automatic parameter optimization** based on building thermal response
- **Seasonal adaptation** happens transparently to the building operator

### **4. Equipment Protection by Default**
- **Equipment cycling protection, safety interlocks, capacity limits** - all automatic
- **Predictive maintenance, performance monitoring, fault detection** - built into runtime
- **Energy compliance, comfort validation, operational bounds** - handled by domain profile

## **The POET Promise: Simple Control Logic, Intelligent Building**

```python
# What engineer writes (thermal control only):
@poet(domain="building_management", learning="on")
def control_hvac_zone(current_temp: float, setpoint: float, 
                     occupancy: bool, outdoor_temp: float, zone_id: str) -> HVACCommand:
    temp_error = current_temp - setpoint
    comfort_band = 1.0 if occupancy else 3.0
    
    if abs(temp_error) <= comfort_band:
        return HVACCommand(0, 0, 20, "Maintaining")
    elif temp_error < -comfort_band:
        heating = min(100, abs(temp_error) * 25)
        return HVACCommand(heating, 0, 60, "Heating")
    else:
        cooling = min(100, temp_error * 25)
        return HVACCommand(0, cooling, 60, "Cooling")

# What building gets automatically:
# ✅ Weather-predictive control
# ✅ Occupancy-aware optimization  
# ✅ Equipment protection and staging
# ✅ Energy cost minimization
# ✅ Comfort guarantee and validation
# ✅ Continuous learning and adaptation
# ✅ Seasonal strategy switching
# ✅ Multi-zone coordination
```

**This is the essence of POET applied to building management: Transform basic temperature control into intelligent, adaptive building systems with minimal configuration and zero custom HVAC expertise required.**
