# Financial Risk Assessment with POET

## Use Case Overview

**Industry**: Financial Services  
**Problem**: Credit risk assessment for loan applications requiring real-time decisions with regulatory compliance  
**POET Value**: Transform naive business logic into enterprise-grade financial system

## Business Context

A mid-size bank processes 500+ loan applications daily, requiring:
- **Fast decisions** (under 2 minutes for pre-approval)
- **Regulatory compliance** (Fair Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act)
- **Risk accuracy** (minimize default rates while maximizing approvals)
- **Audit trail** (full decision transparency for regulators)
- **Adaptive learning** (improve risk models based on actual loan performance)

## Traditional Challenges

### Before POET Implementation:
```python
# Traditional brittle approach
def assess_credit_risk(application_data: dict) -> dict:
    # Hard-coded rules that break with data variations
    credit_score = application_data['credit_score']  # Fails if field missing
    income = float(application_data['annual_income'])  # Fails on format issues
    
    # Static risk thresholds that don't adapt
    if credit_score > 750 and income > 50000:
        return {"decision": "approved", "rate": 3.5}
    else:
        return {"decision": "denied"}
    
    # No learning from actual loan performance
    # No regulatory compliance validation
    # No handling of edge cases
```

**Problems:**
- **Data fragility**: Breaks on missing fields or format variations
- **Static rules**: No adaptation to market changes or performance data
- **Compliance gaps**: No systematic validation of regulatory requirements
- **Poor edge case handling**: Unusual applications cause system failures
- **No learning**: Missed opportunities to improve accuracy over time

## POET Solution: Minimal Code, Maximum Intelligence

### What the Engineer Writes (Simple Business Logic)
```python
from opendxa.common.poet.executor import poet
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class CreditDecision:
    approved: bool
    interest_rate: float = None
    reason: str = None

@poet(
    domain="financial_services",  # Automatic compliance + audit trails
    learning="on"                 # Continuous improvement from outcomes
)
def assess_credit_risk(credit_score: int, annual_income: float, 
                      debt_to_income: float, employment_years: int) -> CreditDecision:
    """
    Assess credit risk for loan applications.
    
    Business rules for loan approval based on applicant financial profile.
    POET handles data validation, compliance, audit trails, and learning.
    """
    
    # Simple, naive business logic - no error handling needed
    risk_score = (
        (credit_score / 850) * 0.4 +           # 40% weight on credit score
        (min(annual_income / 100000, 1)) * 0.3 + # 30% weight on income (capped)
        (max(0, 1 - debt_to_income / 0.5)) * 0.2 + # 20% weight on debt ratio
        (min(employment_years / 10, 1)) * 0.1    # 10% weight on job stability
    )
    
    # Simple decision thresholds
    if risk_score >= 0.7:
        return CreditDecision(approved=True, interest_rate=3.5, reason="Prime candidate")
    elif risk_score >= 0.5:
        return CreditDecision(approved=True, interest_rate=5.2, reason="Standard rate")
    elif risk_score >= 0.3:
        return CreditDecision(approved=True, interest_rate=7.8, reason="Subprime rate")
    else:
        return CreditDecision(approved=False, reason="High risk profile")
```

### What POET Runtime Provides Automatically (No Code Written)

#### **Perceive Stage (Automatic Data Intelligence)**
```python
# POET automatically handles:
# ✅ Data format variations ("750", 750, "Seven-fifty" all work for credit_score)
# ✅ Missing field handling (requests missing data or uses reasonable defaults)
# ✅ Income normalization ("$50,000", "50K", "50000" all convert to 50000.0)
# ✅ Data cleaning (removes invalid characters, handles typos)
# ✅ Context enrichment (adds market data, economic indicators)
# ✅ Fraud detection (flags suspicious application patterns)

# Example automatic transformations:
input_variations = [
    {"credit_score": "750", "annual_income": "$65,000", "debt_to_income": "0.3", "employment_years": "5"},
    {"credit_score": 750, "annual_income": "65K", "debt_to_income": 0.3, "employment_years": 5.2},
    {"credit_score": "Seven-fifty", "annual_income": 65000, "debt_to_income": "30%", "employment_years": "5 years"}
]
# All automatically converted to: credit_score=750, annual_income=65000.0, debt_to_income=0.3, employment_years=5
```

#### **Enforce Stage (Automatic Compliance & Quality)**
```python
# POET automatically provides:
# ✅ Regulatory compliance validation (FCRA, ECOA requirements)
# ✅ Audit trail generation (who, what, when, why for every decision)
# ✅ Output standardization (consistent decision format)
# ✅ Required disclosures (adverse action notices, credit score factors)
# ✅ Data governance (PII protection, retention policies)
# ✅ Performance monitoring (decision quality tracking)

# Automatic audit trail for every decision:
{
    "execution_id": "exec_12345",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "decision": {"approved": True, "interest_rate": 3.5},
    "compliance_checks": ["FCRA_615", "ECOA_202", "GDPR_Article_22"],
    "risk_factors": {"credit_score": 780, "income_stability": "high"},
    "regulatory_disclosures": ["Prime rate disclosure", "Credit factors notice"],
    "model_version": "risk_model_v2.1",
    "performance_metrics": {"processing_time_ms": 45, "confidence": 0.92}
}
```

#### **Train Stage (Automatic Learning)**
```python
# POET automatically learns:
# ✅ Optimal risk thresholds (adjusts 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 based on loan performance)
# ✅ Feature importance (learns which factors matter most for actual defaults)
# ✅ Market adaptation (adjusts for economic conditions automatically)
# ✅ Fraud patterns (improves detection based on discovered fraud)
# ✅ Processing optimization (learns faster pathways for common cases)

# Learning happens automatically from business outcomes:
# - Loan defaults → adjust risk thresholds down
# - Economic changes → modify income weighting
# - New fraud patterns → enhance detection rules
# - Processing bottlenecks → optimize data pathways
```
    
### Usage Examples

#### **Simple Function Call (Same as Before)**
```python
# Engineer calls the function normally - POET magic happens automatically
result = assess_credit_risk(
    credit_score=750,
    annual_income=65000,
    debt_to_income=0.3,
    employment_years=5
)
# Returns: CreditDecision(approved=True, interest_rate=3.5, reason="Prime candidate")
```

#### **Messy Real-World Data (POET Handles Automatically)**
```python
# This would break traditional functions, but POET handles gracefully
messy_application = {
    "credit_score": "Seven hundred fifty",  # Text credit score
    "annual_income": "$65,000 per year",    # Formatted income  
    "debt_to_income": "30%",                # Percentage format
    "employment_years": "5 years 3 months", # Text duration
    "extra_field": "irrelevant data"        # Extra fields ignored
}

# POET automatically extracts and converts:
# credit_score=750, annual_income=65000.0, debt_to_income=0.3, employment_years=5
result = assess_credit_risk(**messy_application)  # Just works!
```

#### **Missing Data (POET Requests or Defaults)**
```python
# Incomplete data - POET handles intelligently
incomplete_application = {
    "credit_score": 750,
    # Missing annual_income, debt_to_income, employment_years
}

# POET either:
# 1. Requests missing critical data via interrupt
# 2. Uses learned defaults for non-critical fields  
# 3. Gracefully handles with confidence scoring
result = assess_credit_risk(**incomplete_application)
```

## POET's Built-in Domain Intelligence

### **Financial Services Domain Profile**
```python
# POET provides pre-built domain profiles - no custom code needed
FINANCIAL_SERVICES_PROFILE = {
    "compliance_frameworks": ["FCRA", "ECOA", "GDPR_Article_22", "SOX"],
    "audit_requirements": {
        "decision_logging": True,
        "data_lineage": True,
        "model_explainability": True,
        "retention_period": "7_years"
    },
    "data_patterns": {
        "credit_score": {"range": [300, 850], "formats": ["numeric", "text"]},
        "income": {"formats": ["$50,000", "50K", "50000"], "required": True},
        "ssn": {"pii": True, "encryption": "required"},
        "addresses": {"standardization": "USPS"}
    },
    "business_rules": {
        "max_processing_time": 120,  # seconds
        "confidence_threshold": 0.8,
        "human_review_triggers": ["edge_cases", "high_value", "appeals"]
    },
    "learning_constraints": {
        "bias_monitoring": ["race", "gender", "age", "geography"],
        "fairness_metrics": ["equal_opportunity", "demographic_parity"],
        "explainability_required": True
    }
}
```

### **Automatic Compliance Validation**
```python
# POET automatically validates every decision against regulations:

@poet(domain="financial_services")  # This single line provides:
def assess_credit_risk(...):
    # ✅ FCRA Section 615: Adverse action notices automatically generated
    # ✅ ECOA compliance: No discrimination checks automatically applied  
    # ✅ Model explainability: Decision factors automatically captured
    # ✅ Audit trails: Complete decision history automatically logged
    # ✅ Bias monitoring: Fairness metrics automatically tracked
    # ✅ Data governance: PII protection automatically applied
    pass

# Example automatic compliance output:
{
    "decision": {"approved": False, "reason": "High risk profile"},
    "regulatory_compliance": {
        "adverse_action_notice": "Required disclosures have been generated",
        "fcra_compliance": "Section 615 requirements met",
        "ecoa_compliance": "No prohibited factors used in decision",
        "bias_check": "Decision within fairness thresholds"
    },
    "required_disclosures": [
        "Credit score was a key factor in this decision",
        "You have the right to obtain a free copy of your credit report",
        "You may dispute inaccurate information in your credit report"
    ]
}
```

### **Concrete Example: Learning in Action**

```python
# MONTH 1: Engineer deploys naive function
application = {"credit_score": 750, "annual_income": 65000, "debt_to_income": 0.3, "employment_years": 5}

# Original naive calculation:
risk_score = (750/850)*0.4 + min(65000/100000,1)*0.3 + max(0,1-0.3/0.5)*0.2 + min(5/10,1)*0.1
risk_score = 0.353 + 0.195 + 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.678
# Decision: DENIED (below 0.7 threshold)

# MONTH 6: After learning from 1000 loan outcomes
# POET learned through actual defaults:
# - debt_to_income is more predictive than expected (weight: 0.2 → 0.3)
# - credit_score is less predictive than expected (weight: 0.4 → 0.35)
# - threshold should be 0.68 instead of 0.7 for prime approval

# Same application now processed by POET runtime:
learned_weights = [0.35, 0.25, 0.3, 0.1]  # Updated weights
learned_thresholds = [0.68, 0.48, 0.28]   # Updated thresholds

# POET calculates what the score SHOULD be with learned weights:
target_risk_score = (750/850)*0.35 + min(65000/100000,1)*0.25 + max(0,1-0.3/0.5)*0.3 + min(5/10,1)*0.1
target_risk_score = 0.309 + 0.163 + 0.12 + 0.05 = 0.642

# POET applies learned threshold (0.48 instead of 0.5):
# Decision: APPROVED at standard rate (0.642 > 0.48)

# Engineer's function never changed, but behavior evolved through learning!

### **Key Insight: Runtime Interception at Every Stage**

The crucial insight is that **POET runtime intercepts the engineer's function execution** at multiple points and applies comprehensive processing automatically:

1. **P (Perceive)**: Normalizes messy inputs, detects fraud, enriches with market context
2. **O (Operate)**: Calls engineer's unchanged function with clean inputs  
3. **E (Enforce)**: Validates output, ensures compliance, generates audit trails
4. **T (Train)**: Learns from outcomes and adjusts parameters transparently

**Engineer writes 8 lines, gets enterprise-grade system** with:
- Automatic data cleaning and normalization
- Built-in regulatory compliance validation  
- Comprehensive audit trails and disclosures
- Bias detection and fairness monitoring
- Continuous learning and improvement

This is how naive business logic becomes enterprise-ready through runtime enhancement rather than custom infrastructure code.
```

## Automatic Monitoring and Alerts

### **Built-in Performance Monitoring**
```python
# POET automatically monitors all critical metrics:

@poet(domain="financial_services", learning="on")
def assess_credit_risk(...):
    # POET automatically tracks:
    # ✅ Processing time (alerts if >2 minutes)
    # ✅ Approval rates (alerts on 10%+ change) 
    # ✅ Compliance violations (alerts on any violation)
    # ✅ Model accuracy (alerts on 5%+ drop)
    # ✅ Bias metrics (alerts on fairness threshold breach)
    # ✅ Data quality (alerts on incomplete/invalid data spike)
    pass

# Example automatic alert:
{
    "alert_type": "approval_rate_change",
    "severity": "medium",
    "current_value": 0.73,
    "baseline_value": 0.81,
    "change_percent": -9.9,
    "possible_causes": [
        "Economic conditions changed",
        "Credit score distribution shifted", 
        "Model parameters updated"
    ],
    "recommended_actions": [
        "Review recent parameter changes",
        "Check market condition indicators",
        "Analyze recent application patterns"
    ]
}
```

### **Automatic Bias Detection**
```python
# POET continuously monitors for discriminatory patterns:

# Automatic fairness analysis:
{
    "fairness_metrics": {
        "demographic_parity": {
            "overall_approval_rate": 0.78,
            "by_protected_class": {
                "age_18_25": 0.74,  # Within 5% tolerance
                "age_26_35": 0.79,
                "age_36_50": 0.80,
                "age_51_plus": 0.76
            },
            "bias_detected": False
        },
        "equal_opportunity": {
            "qualified_approval_rates": {
                "high_income": 0.95,
                "medium_income": 0.94,  # Good - similar rates for qualified applicants
                "low_income": 0.93
            },
            "bias_detected": False
        }
    },
    "recommendations": "Continue current model - no bias detected"
}
```

## Business Impact: Before vs After POET

### **The Transformation**

#### **Before POET (Traditional Approach)**
```python
def assess_credit_risk(application_data: dict) -> dict:
    # 200+ lines of brittle code for:
    # - Manual data validation
    # - Hard-coded business rules  
    # - Custom error handling
    # - Manual compliance checks
    # - Static logging
    # - No learning capability
    
    # Result: 180s processing, 82% accuracy, 3% compliance violations
```

#### **After POET (8 Lines of Business Logic)**
```python
@poet(domain="financial_services", learning="on")
def assess_credit_risk(credit_score: int, annual_income: float, 
                      debt_to_income: float, employment_years: int) -> CreditDecision:
    """Simple risk assessment with automatic enterprise capabilities."""
    
    risk_score = (credit_score/850)*0.4 + min(annual_income/100000,1)*0.3 + \
                 max(0,1-debt_to_income/0.5)*0.2 + min(employment_years/10,1)*0.1
    
    if risk_score >= 0.7: return CreditDecision(True, 3.5, "Prime")
    elif risk_score >= 0.5: return CreditDecision(True, 5.2, "Standard")  
    elif risk_score >= 0.3: return CreditDecision(True, 7.8, "Subprime")
    else: return CreditDecision(False, None, "High risk")
    
    # Result: 45s processing, 94% accuracy, 0.2% compliance violations
```

## Key POET Design Principles Demonstrated

### **1. Minimal Code, Maximum Intelligence**
- **8 lines** of business logic vs **200+ lines** of traditional code
- Engineer focuses on **risk assessment algorithm**, POET handles everything else
- **No custom error handling, data validation, or compliance code needed**

### **2. Domain Intelligence Built-In**
- `domain="financial_services"` provides automatic compliance and audit trails
- Pre-built understanding of credit scores, income formats, regulatory requirements
- **No need to research or implement FCRA, ECOA, or bias detection rules**

### **3. Automatic Learning Without ML Expertise**
- System improves accuracy from **82% to 94%** without data scientist involvement
- **Automatic threshold optimization** based on loan performance outcomes
- **Market adaptation** happens transparently to the business user

### **4. Enterprise-Grade by Default**
- **Audit trails, compliance checking, bias monitoring** - all automatic
- **Performance monitoring, alerting, escalation** - built into the runtime
- **Security, data governance, retention policies** - handled by domain profile

## **The POET Promise: Simple Functions, Enterprise Power**

```python
# What engineer writes (business logic only):
@poet(domain="financial_services", learning="on")
def assess_credit_risk(credit_score: int, annual_income: float, 
                      debt_to_income: float, employment_years: int) -> CreditDecision:
    risk_score = calculate_weighted_risk_score(...)
    return make_decision_based_on_thresholds(risk_score)

# What enterprise gets automatically:
# ✅ Data validation and cleaning
# ✅ Regulatory compliance (FCRA, ECOA)  
# ✅ Audit trails and documentation
# ✅ Bias monitoring and fairness
# ✅ Performance tracking and alerting
# ✅ Continuous learning and improvement
# ✅ Error handling and retry logic
# ✅ Security and data governance
```

## POET Intelligence Distribution in Action

This example demonstrates how POET's 80/20 intelligence model works:

### 80% Generalizable Intelligence (Provided Automatically)
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- **Performance Optimization**: Parameter tuning based on response times  
- **Learning Algorithms**: Basic gradient descent for threshold optimization
- **Security**: Audit trail generation and PII protection
- **Quality Validation**: Output type checking and format validation
- **Resource Management**: Connection pooling and timeout enforcement

### 20% Domain-Specific Intelligence (`domain="financial_services"`)
- **FCRA Compliance**: Automatic adverse action notice generation
- **Credit Score Normalization**: Handles "750", "excellent", text formats
- **Risk Threshold Optimization**: Learns optimal approval/denial boundaries
- **Bias Detection**: Demographic parity and equal opportunity monitoring
- **Financial Data Validation**: Income parsing, debt ratio calculation
- **Regulatory Reporting**: SOX compliance and audit trail formatting

### Result: 8 Lines → Enterprise Financial System
The engineer writes 8 lines of business logic. POET automatically applies:
- 80% generalizable patterns (works for any domain)
- 20% financial services expertise (domain="financial_services")
- Zero custom compliance, learning, or infrastructure code needed

**This is the essence of POET: Transform naive business logic into enterprise-grade intelligent systems through intelligent architecture that combines universal patterns with domain expertise.**
