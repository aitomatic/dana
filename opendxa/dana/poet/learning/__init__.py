"""
Advanced T-Stage Learning Components for POET

This module implements sophisticated learning algorithms that enhance
the basic T-stage heuristics with statistical methods, pattern recognition,
and cross-function intelligence sharing.

Components:
- OnlineLearner: Real-time statistical parameter optimization
- BatchLearner: Periodic pattern analysis and deep insights
- CrossFunctionLearner: Knowledge sharing between similar functions
- AdaptiveLearner: Self-optimizing learning strategy selection
