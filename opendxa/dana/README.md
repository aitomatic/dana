# DANA (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture)

## 🧭 Vision

DANA is a universal program format and execution runtime that enables intelligent agents — human or machine — to reason, act, and collaborate through structured, interpretable programs.

It serves as the missing link between natural language objectives and tool-assisted, stateful action. DANA programs are concise, auditable, explainable, and can be authored by LLMs, domain experts, or both.

---

## 💡 Motivation & Problem

Modern AI systems struggle with:

* ✖️ **Prompt chains are fragile** — hard to debug, hard to maintain
* ✖️ **Plans are opaque** — impossible to inspect or explain mid-flight
* ✖️ **Tool use is scattered** — logic is buried in code, not declarative programs
* ✖️ **State is implicit** — no shared memory model or traceable updates

Symbolic systems offer structure but lack adaptability. LLMs offer creativity but lack transparency. DANA bridges the two.

---

## ✅ Solution

DANA introduces a lightweight domain-aware program language and runtime. It allows:

* 🧠 **Programs as first-class reasoning artifacts**
* 📦 **Shared state containers** (`agent`, `world`, `temp`, `execution`)
* 🧩 **Reusable logic units** via a structured Knowledge Base (KB)
* 🧾 **Declarative goals**, **imperative execution**
* 📜 **Bidirectional mapping to/from natural language**

DANA can:

* Be generated by a planning agent (like GMA)
* Be executed line-by-line by a runtime
* Interact with tools, LLMs, and memory
* Be stored, versioned, tested, and explained

---

## 🔁 Execution Flow (Simplified)

1. **AgentRuntime** receives an objective and instantiates a `RuntimeContext`
2. **GMA** emits a DANA program — either fresh or retrieved from the KB
3. **Interpreter** walks the program step by step
4. **reason(...)** calls LLMs, **use(...)** calls KB/tools, **set(...)** modifies state
5. All logic runs against an auditable shared memory model

---

## 🧱 State Model

DANA programs operate over a shared `RuntimeContext`, which is composed of three standard memory scopes:

| Scope      | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `private:` | Private to the agent, resource, or tool itself |
| `public:`  | Openly accessible world state (time, weather, etc.) |
| `system:`  | System-related mechanical state with controlled access |

The `RuntimeContext` enforces strict scope boundaries and provides controlled access to state variables through dot notation (e.g., `private.user.name`, `public.weather.temperature`, `system.status`).

### Security Design

**The `dana.runtime` module is the primary enforcer of security during the execution of a DANA program.** It manages the `RuntimeContext` for the duration of the execution and enforces access policies based on the defined scopes and program logic.

| Security Concern            | Enforced By              | Mechanism                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Scope restrictions          | `dana.runtime`           | Limits visible/writable scopes during execution |
| State mutation permissions  | `dana.runtime`           | Controlled state updates via instructions      |
| Tool/API usage validation   | `dana.runtime`           | Ensures `use` targets are valid/allowed        |
| LLM output handling         | `dana.runtime`           | Manages `reason` call results and potential errors |
| Execution logging           | `dana.runtime`           | Tracks execution steps within the DANA context |
| Resource constraints        | `dana.runtime`           | (Optional) Limits execution steps, time, memory |

```python
if world.sensor.temp > 100:
    temp.result = reason("Is this overheating?")
    if temp.result == "yes":
        execution.alerts.append("Overheat detected")
```

## 🔧 Architecture Notes

The DANA runtime uses a robust architecture combining several design patterns:

- **Visitor Pattern**: AST nodes are traversed using dedicated visit methods, allowing clean separation of node types and operations
- **Hook System**: Extensible event system for customizing behavior at key execution points (before/after program, statements, errors)
- **Context Management**: Hierarchical state management with namespaced scopes
- **Function Registry**: Dynamic registration of tools and functions
- **Type System**: Static type checking with runtime validation
- **Logging System**: Configurable logging with color-coded levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- **Modular Transformers**: The parser uses specialized transformer components for different language constructs, improving maintainability and extensibility

Key Features:
- Asynchronous execution support
- F-string interpolation in log messages
- Error location tracking and formatting
- Execution ID tracking for debugging
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions

> **Note**: The runtime is designed to be extensible through hooks and function registration, allowing for custom behavior without modifying core code.

## 📦 Public API

Designed for use inside agentic systems:

```python
from opendxa.dana import run, compile_nl, explain
from opendxa.dana.sandbox.sandbox_context import SandboxContext
from opendxa.dana.sandbox.interpreter import Interpreter

# Basic usage
program = compile_nl("If X is drifting, flag it.")
ctx = RuntimeContext(agent=..., world=..., temp={})
run(program, ctx)

# Advanced usage with custom interpreter
interpreter = Interpreter(ctx)
interpreter.set_log_level(LogLevel.DEBUG)
interpreter.execute_program(program)
```
