# DANA (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture)

## 🧭 Vision

DANA is a universal program format and execution runtime that enables intelligent agents — human or machine — to reason, act, and collaborate through structured, interpretable programs.

It serves as the missing link between natural language objectives and tool-assisted, stateful action. DANA programs are concise, auditable, explainable, and can be authored by LLMs, domain experts, or both.

---

## 💡 Motivation & Problem

Modern AI systems struggle with:

* ✖️ **Prompt chains are fragile** — hard to debug, hard to maintain
* ✖️ **Plans are opaque** — impossible to inspect or explain mid-flight
* ✖️ **Tool use is scattered** — logic is buried in code, not declarative programs
* ✖️ **State is implicit** — no shared memory model or traceable updates

Symbolic systems offer structure but lack adaptability. LLMs offer creativity but lack transparency. DANA bridges the two.

---

## ✅ Solution

DANA introduces a lightweight domain-aware program language and runtime. It allows:

* 🧠 **Programs as first-class reasoning artifacts**
* 📦 **Shared state containers** (`agent`, `world`, `temp`, `execution`)
* 🧩 **Reusable logic units** via a structured Knowledge Base (KB)
* 🧾 **Declarative goals**, **imperative execution**
* 📜 **Bidirectional mapping to/from natural language**

DANA can:

* Be generated by a planning agent (like GMA)
* Be executed line-by-line by a runtime
* Interact with tools, LLMs, and memory
* Be stored, versioned, tested, and explained

---

## 🔁 Execution Flow (Simplified)

1. **AgentRuntime** receives an objective and instantiates a `RuntimeContext`
2. **GMA** emits a DANA program — either fresh or retrieved from the KB
3. **Interpreter** walks the program step by step
4. **reason(...)** calls LLMs, **use(...)** calls KB/tools, **set(...)** modifies state
5. All logic runs against an auditable shared memory model

---

## 🧱 State Model

DANA programs access shared memory via namespaced keys:

* `agent:` — beliefs, identity, preferences
* `world:` — sensed external state
* `execution:` — goals, status, logs
* `temp:` — ephemeral local memory
* `private:` — local scope variables
* `system:` — runtime configuration (log levels, execution ID)

```python
if world.sensor.temp > 100:
    temp.result = reason("Is this overheating?")
    if temp.result == "yes":
        execution.alerts.append("Overheat detected")
```

## 🔧 Architecture Notes

The DANA runtime uses a robust architecture combining several design patterns:

- **Visitor Pattern**: AST nodes are traversed using dedicated visit methods, allowing clean separation of node types and operations
- **Hook System**: Extensible event system for customizing behavior at key execution points (before/after program, statements, errors)
- **Context Management**: Hierarchical state management with namespaced scopes
- **Function Registry**: Dynamic registration of tools and functions
- **Type System**: Static type checking with runtime validation
- **Logging System**: Configurable logging with color-coded levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)

Key Features:
- Asynchronous execution support
- F-string interpolation in log messages
- Error location tracking and formatting
- Execution ID tracking for debugging
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions

> **Note**: The runtime is designed to be extensible through hooks and function registration, allowing for custom behavior without modifying core code.

## 📦 Public API

Designed for use inside agentic systems:

```python
from dana import run, compile_nl, explain
from dana.runtime.context import RuntimeContext
from dana.runtime.interpreter import Interpreter

# Basic usage
program = compile_nl("If X is drifting, flag it.")
ctx = RuntimeContext(agent=..., world=..., temp={})
run(program, ctx)

# Advanced usage with custom interpreter
interpreter = Interpreter(ctx)
interpreter.set_log_level(LogLevel.DEBUG)
interpreter.execute_program(program)
```

---

## 🔗 Benefits

* ✅ Uniform execution across agents, tools, LLMs
* ✅ Declarative planning, imperative acting
* ✅ Human-readable and explainable
* ✅ Reusable logic and modular KB
* ✅ Plug-and-play with OpenDXA or other agent frameworks

---

## 🔄 Bidirectional Layer

DANA includes tools to:

* Convert NL to structured code (`compile_nl()`)
* Translate programs back to natural language (`explain()`)

This enables:

* Domain experts to author rules in English
* Systems to explain what they're doing
* Co-creation and trust in AI workflows

---

## 🧩 Example Use Cases

* Semiconductor diagnostics
* Financial credit assessment
* Predictive maintenance
* Maritime risk control
* Regulatory eligibility checks

---

## 🤝 Relationship to OpenDXA

* DANA is embedded within OpenDXA as the **reasoning and execution layer**
* Agents emit or receive DANA programs to carry out goals
* Tool calls and reasoning steps all route through DANA
* The KB provides reusable domain logic to DXAs and GMAs

---

## 🛠 Status

DANA is under active development and currently embedded inside `OpenDXA` as a module. Refactoring and extraction to an independent package is supported by clean modular structure.

> Future direction includes formal spec, test suite, and runtime service for multi-agent environments.
