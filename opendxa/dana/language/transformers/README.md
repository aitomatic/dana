# DANA Language Parser Components

This directory contains the modular components of the DANA language parser. The parser uses a modular architecture with specialized transformer components for different language constructs.

## Structure

The parser consists of these components:

- **base_transformer.py**: Base transformer with shared utility methods
- **expression_transformer.py**: Handles expression parsing (binary operations, literals, etc.)
- **statement_transformer.py**: Handles statement parsing (assignments, conditionals, etc.)
- **fstring_transformer.py**: Handles f-string parsing and evaluation
- **main_transformer.py**: Integrates all transformers and delegates to the appropriate one

## Testing

Tests for the parser are in `tests/dana/test_modular_parser.py`. These tests validate that the parser correctly handles all DANA language features.

To run the tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/dana/test_modular_parser.py
```

## Benefits of the Modular Design

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and maintain
2. **Better Error Handling**: Extracted error handling utilities provide more consistent error messages
3. **Easier Extension**: Adding new language features is easier with the modular design
4. **Better Testing**: More focused components allow for more precise tests

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the parser:

1. Add more extensive test coverage
2. Further break down large transformer methods
3. Add better documentation for each transformer method
4. Optimize performance by reducing redundant operations
5. Consider a visitor-based approach for error handling
