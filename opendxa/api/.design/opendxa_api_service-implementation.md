- [ ] **Deployment Pipeline**: CI/CD for service deployments

## Quality Gates (Beta)
⚠️  Platform implementation gates for Beta:
✅ Service registry working with at least 2 services (POET + one other)
✅ Unified authentication across all services  
✅ Performance targets met for each service type
✅ Complete OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
✅ Load testing passed with target concurrent users
✅ Security audit completed
✅ Client SDK supporting all registered services

## Service Implementation Strategy

### Service Plugin Interface
```python
# Standard interface all services must implement
class OpenDXAService:
    def get_name(self) -> str: pass
    def get_routes(self) -> APIRouter: pass  
    def get_health_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: pass
    def get_openapi_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: pass
```

### Service Registration Process
1. **Service Development**: Implement OpenDXAService interface
2. **Route Definition**: FastAPI router with service endpoints
3. **Schema Generation**: OpenAPI specification for documentation
4. **Health Checks**: Service-specific health monitoring
5. **Registration**: Register with platform service registry
6. **Testing**: Automated testing through platform test suite

## Technical Debt & Maintenance
- [ ] **Service Performance**: Response time monitoring per service
- [ ] **Platform Scalability**: Auto-scaling configuration
- [ ] **Documentation**: Keep OpenAPI specs synchronized
- [ ] **Security**: Regular security audits and updates
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Platform-wide observability
- [ ] **Client SDKs**: Multi-language client library support

## Configuration Strategy

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Single configuration point for all services
AITOMATIC_API_URL=local                           # Alpha: local mode
AITOMATIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080           # Beta: local server  
AITOMATIC_API_URL=https://api.aitomatic.com       # Production: hosted service
AITOMATIC_API_KEY=sk-ait-xxxxx                    # Authentication for remote

# Service-specific configuration
OPENDXA_SERVICE_TIMEOUT=30                        # Default timeout
OPENDXA_RATE_LIMIT=100                           # Requests per minute
OPENDXA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO                           # Logging level
```

### Service Discovery
```python
# Client usage - unified interface
from opendxa.api.client import OpenDXAClient

client = OpenDXAClient()  # Auto-detects available services
services = client.get_available_services()  # ["poet", "prompt", "magic"]

# Service-specific clients
poet = client.get_service("poet")
result = poet.transpile(function_code, config)
```
