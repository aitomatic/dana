## Service Implementation Strategy

### Service Plugin Interface
```python
# Standard interface all services must implement
class OpenDXAService:
    def get_name(self) -> str: pass
    def get_routes(self) -> APIRouter: pass  
    def get_health_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: pass
    def get_openapi_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: pass
```

### Automatic Lifecycle Management Implementation

**Resource Management Architecture**:
```python
# DanaSandbox manages session resources
class DanaSandbox:
    def _ensure_initialized(self):
        # Lazy initialization on first use
        self._api_service = APIServiceManager()
        self._api_service.startup()  # Starts localhost:8080
        
        self._api_client = self._api_service.get_client()
        self._api_client.startup()   # Validates connection
        
        # Store in context for sharing
        self._context.set("system.api_client", self._api_client)

# Global POET service for standalone usage  
def get_poet_api_client() -> APIClient:
    global _global_poet_service
    if not _global_poet_service:
        _global_poet_service = APIServiceManager()
        _global_poet_service.startup()
    return _global_poet_service.get_client()
```

**Implementation Status**:
- [x] **APIServiceManager**: Session-scoped server lifecycle management
- [x] **APIClient**: Startup/shutdown with connection validation  
- [x] **LLMResource**: Sync/async lifecycle with lazy initialization
- [x] **DanaSandbox**: Automatic resource initialization and cleanup
- [x] **SandboxContext**: Local state management only
- [x] **Global POET Service**: Standalone usage with atexit cleanup

### Service Registration Process
1. **Service Development**: Implement OpenDXAService interface
2. **Route Definition**: FastAPI router with service endpoints
3. **Schema Generation**: OpenAPI specification for documentation
4. **Health Checks**: Service-specific health monitoring
5. **Lifecycle Integration**: Automatic startup/shutdown management
5. **Registration**: Register with platform service registry
6. **Testing**: Automated testing through platform test suite

## Technical Debt & Maintenance
- [ ] **Service Performance**: Response time monitoring per service
- [ ] **Platform Scalability**: Auto-scaling configuration
- [ ] **Documentation**: Keep OpenAPI specs synchronized
- [ ] **Security**: Regular security audits and updates
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Platform-wide observability
- [ ] **Client SDKs**: Multi-language client library support

## Configuration Strategy

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Single configuration point for all services
AITOMATIC_API_URL=local                           # Alpha: local mode (localhost:8080)
AITOMATIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080           # Beta: local server (explicit)  
AITOMATIC_API_URL=https://api.aitomatic.com       # Production: hosted service
AITOMATIC_API_KEY=sk-ait-xxxxx                    # Authentication for remote

# Local development requires server:
# make opendxa-server  # MUST run this command

# Service-specific configuration
OPENDXA_SERVICE_TIMEOUT=30                        # Default timeout
OPENDXA_RATE_LIMIT=100                           # Requests per minute
OPENDXA_LOG_LEVEL=INFO                           # Logging level
```

### Service Discovery
```python
# Client usage - unified interface (requires server running)
from opendxa.api.client import OpenDXAClient

# Note: make opendxa-server must be running for local development
client = OpenDXAClient()  # Connects to server, auto-detects available services
services = client.get_available_services()  # ["poet", "prompt", "magic"]

# Service-specific clients - all require server connection
poet = client.get_service("poet")
result = poet.transpile(function_code, config)
```
