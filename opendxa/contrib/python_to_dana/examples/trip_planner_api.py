Weather-Smart Trip Planner API - FastAPI + Dana Integration Example

This example demonstrates how FastAPI developers can add sophisticated,
weather-aware trip planning intelligence to their applications using Dana's
reasoning capabilities with zero AI/ML expertise required.

Key Features:
- Natural language reasoning for complex trip optimization
- Familiar FastAPI patterns with Dana seamlessly integrated
- Production-ready error handling and validation

Usage:
    python -m uvicorn trip_planner_api:app --reload

Example request:
    POST /trips/plan
    {
        "destination": "San Francisco",
        "start_date": "2024-01-15",
        "duration_days": 3,
