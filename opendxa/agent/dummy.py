"""Agent runtime for executing plans and managing execution flow.

AgentRuntime is the Imperative/Executive layer in the Declarative-Imperative pattern:

1. Role: Defines HOW the agent executes and manages state
   - Controls execution flow and coordination
   - Manages runtime behavior and state
   - Focuses on the agent's operation and execution

2. Responsibilities:
   - Plan execution management
   - Runtime state coordination
   - Component lifecycle control
   - Execution flow orchestration

3. Configuration:
   - Planning strategy and execution
   - Reasoning strategy and execution
   - Runtime state management
   - Component coordination

Example:
    ```python
    # Configure runtime components
    runtime = AgentRuntime(agent)\\
        .with_planning(strategy=PlanStrategy.DEFAULT)\\
        .with_reasoning(strategy=ReasoningStrategy.DEFAULT)

    # Execute plan with context
    result = await runtime.execute(plan, context)
    ```
