The agent system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for:
- Custom agent capabilities through the capability system
- Integration of external resources through the resource system
- Input/output handling through the IO system

Example:
    >>> from opendxa.agent import Agent
    >>> agent = Agent()
    >>> response = agent.ask("What is quantum computing?")
