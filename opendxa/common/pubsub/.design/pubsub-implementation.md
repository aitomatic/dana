## Implementation Strategy

**Status**: ðŸš« **DEFERRED TO BETA** - Alpha uses in-memory feedback only

**Scope**: PubSub is specifically for DELAYED feedback from external systems (PagerDuty, MLflow, etc.), NOT for immediate feedback via `poet.feedback()`.

## Alpha Alternative

### In-Memory Feedback (Alpha Implementation)
- [âœ…] **AlphaFeedbackSystem**: Simple in-memory feedback processing
- [âœ…] **Direct feedback API**: `poet.feedback(result, data)` works immediately
- [âœ…] **LLM translation**: Universal feedback understanding in Alpha
- [âœ…] **File persistence**: Basic reliability without complex infrastructure
