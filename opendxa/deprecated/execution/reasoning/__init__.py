    DirectReasoning: Simple direct execution
    ChainOfThoughtReasoning: Step-by-step reasoning
    OODAReasoning: Dynamic adaptation loop
    DANAReasoning: Domain-aware computation

Supporting Types:
    ReasoningStatus: Status enums for reasoning steps
    ReasoningLevel: Complexity levels for reasoning
    ReasoningResult: Output from reasoning process
    ReasoningContext: State and resource management
    ReasoningConfig: Configuration options
    ObjectiveState: Objective tracking
