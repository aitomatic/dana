# Network Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
Network connectivity issues can significantly impact business operations. This guide provides systematic troubleshooting steps to diagnose and resolve common network problems.

## Basic Connectivity Tests

### Step 1: Check Physical Connections
- Verify all cables are securely connected
- Check for damaged cables or connectors  
- Ensure network devices have power
- Look for status indicator lights

### Step 2: IP Configuration
```bash
# Check IP configuration
ipconfig /all          # Windows
ifconfig -a            # Linux/Mac

# Release and renew IP address
ipconfig /release && ipconfig /renew
```

### Step 3: DNS Resolution
- Test DNS resolution with `nslookup google.com`
- Try alternative DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
- Clear DNS cache: `ipconfig /flushdns`

## Advanced Diagnostics

### Network Layer Testing
1. **Ping Tests**
   - Ping localhost (127.0.0.1)
   - Ping default gateway
   - Ping external host (google.com)

2. **Traceroute Analysis**
   - Use `tracert` (Windows) or `traceroute` (Linux)
   - Identify where packets are dropped
   - Check for high latency hops

### Application Layer Issues
- Test specific ports: `telnet hostname port`
- Check firewall rules and ACLs
- Verify service status on target systems

## Common Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No connectivity | Restart network adapter |
| Slow performance | Check bandwidth utilization |
| Intermittent issues | Update network drivers |
| DNS problems | Configure reliable DNS servers |

## Escalation Criteria
Contact network administration if:
- Multiple users affected
- Core infrastructure involvement
- Security breach suspected
- Hardware replacement needed
