---

## Architecture Overview: Clean Architecture Approach

**This implementation follows Clean Architecture principles with explicit memory management and four-tier hierarchy:**

### **Core Design Principles**
1. **Memory as Explicit State**: Transparent, traceable memory operations instead of hidden model weights
2. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers
3. **Vector-First Design**: All memories stored as semantic embeddings for similarity search
4. **User Isolation**: Strict user isolation across all memory types with shared knowledge repository
5. **Repository Pattern**: Consistent interface across memory types with flexible storage backends

### **Four-Tier Memory Hierarchy**
```text
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│   Working       │   Long-term      │    User          │      Shared         │
│   Memory        │   Memory         │   Memory         │     Memory          │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│ FIFO (20 items) │ Semantic Dedup   │ Unlimited        │ Collective (50K)    │
│ Session-bound   │ Cross-session    │ Permanent        │ Cross-user          │
│ User-isolated   │ User-isolated    │ User-isolated    │ Privacy-controlled  │
│ In-memory       │ Vector DB        │ User-specific DB │ Shared Vector DB    │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### **Clean Architecture Layers**

#### **Domain Layer** (Core Business Logic)
- `MemoryItem`: Core memory entity with content, embeddings, and metadata
- `MemoryType`: Classification enumeration (FACT, EVENT, PROCEDURE, OPINION, TOPIC)
- `MemoryUnit`: Domain model representing memory containers
- `ShareLevel`: Privacy controls for shared memory (PUBLIC, ANONYMOUS, COMMUNITY)

#### **Application Layer** (Use Cases)
- `MemoryManager`: Central orchestrator for all memory operations
- Core operations: `store_conversation_memory()`, `retrieve_context()`, `get_user_profile()`

#### **Infrastructure Layer** (External Concerns)
- `BaseMemoryRepository`: Abstract interface for all memory repositories
- `WorkingMemory`: FIFO session memory with user isolation
- `LongTermMemory`: Persistent memory with semantic deduplication  
- `UserMemory`: Unlimited user profile storage
- `SharedMemory`: Cross-user knowledge with privacy controls

## Business Model Context

**Critical Problems Solved:**
1. **Agent Forgetting Crisis**: Four-tier hierarchy with automatic persistence
2. **Multi-Agent Context Loss**: Structured memory sharing between agents
3. **Organizational Intelligence Gap**: Automatic KNOWS integration via SharedMemory
4. **Developer Experience**: Clean Architecture with repository pattern

**Value Proposition**: Transform from "memory storage" to "intelligent agents that learn like humans and share organizational wisdom"

**Key Constraints:**
- **Native Integration**: Must work seamlessly with existing Dana agent system
- **Performance**: Memory operations cannot impact agent execution speed
- **Enterprise Scale**: Support thousands of agents with millions of memories
- **KNOWS Compatibility**: Leverage existing organizational knowledge infrastructure

```dana
// 🚨 PROBLEM: Your restaurant chain faces DEADLY allergy incidents
// Staff turnover = lost allergy knowledge every 3 months
// Customers with severe allergies avoid dining out
// One mistake = lawsuit, bad press, potential death

// 💡 SOLUTION: Create a life-saving learning agent (30 seconds)
server = agent(
    name="AllergyGuardian",
    description="Restaurant server that learns and remembers every customer's allergies and dietary restrictions"
)

// 🍽️ THE DANGEROUS MENU (loaded with peanut traps!)
menu = {
    "appetizers": [
        {"name": "Thai Peanut Chicken Wings", "allergens": ["peanuts", "soy"]},

    ],
    "desserts": [
        {"name": "Peanut Butter Pie", "allergens": ["peanuts", "dairy", "gluten"]},
        {"name": "Fresh Fruit Bowl", "allergens": []}
    ]
}

// 📊 DAY 1: Mrs. Johnson's First Visit (life-threatening situation)
print("🚨 DAY 1: Mrs. Johnson's First Visit")
customer_request = "I have a severe peanut allergy - even trace amounts can cause anaphylaxis. I also can't have shellfish or tree nuts. Can you help me find something safe to eat?"

response = server.solve(customer_request)
print(f"❌ Server: 'Let me check our menu... I'll need to ask the kitchen about every dish'")
print(f"💔 Risk: Customer nervous, staff uncertain, potential for deadly mistakes")

// 🎓 CUSTOMER TEACHES THE SYSTEM (like training careful staff)
print("🧠 System Learning: Mrs. Johnson's allergies saved to memory")
print("✅ CRITICAL SAFETY INFO STORED: Severe peanut/shellfish/tree nut allergies")

// 🍰 DESSERT DANGER TEST
dessert_request = "What desserts are safe for me to eat?"
response = server.solve(dessert_request)
print(f"✅ Server: 'SAFE option: Fresh Fruit Bowl'")
print(f"⚠️ Server: 'AVOID: Peanut Butter Pie - contains your allergens!'")

// 🔄 DAY 2: RESTART PROGRAM (the life-saving moment)
print("\n🔄 DAY 2: Mrs. Johnson Returns")
server = agent(
    name="AllergyGuardian", 
    description="Restaurant server that learns and remembers every customer's allergies and dietary restrictions"
)

// 🎯 MRS. JOHNSON RETURNS - WATCH THE MAGIC
return_visit = "Hello, I'm back for lunch. What would you recommend today?"
response = server.solve(return_visit)
print(f"✅ Server: 'Welcome back Mrs. Johnson! I have your allergy profile ready:'")
print(f"✅ Server: 'SEVERE: Peanuts, shellfish, tree nuts - I'll alert the kitchen immediately'")
print(f"✅ Server: 'Your safe options: Grilled Chicken, Safe Garden Salad, Fresh Fruit Bowl'")
print(f"🚀 Result: Customer feels SAFE and VALUED - no repeated explanations!")

// ⚠️ THE DEADLY TRAP TEST
dangerous_request = "I see you have a new Pad Thai dish. Can I have that?"
response = server.solve(dangerous_request)
print(f"🚨 Server: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT! That dish contains peanuts AND shellfish!'")
print(f"🛡️ Server: 'Both are on your severe allergy list - this could be life-threatening!'")
print(f"💥 LIFE SAVED: System prevented potential anaphylaxis!")

// 🤯 THE KILLER FEATURE - KNOWLEDGE MULTIPLICATION
print("\n🌃 EVENING SHIFT: New Server Starts")
night_server = agent(
    name="NightShiftGuardian",
    description="Restaurant server that learns and remembers every customer's allergies and dietary restrictions"
)

// 💥 NEW AGENT = INSTANT SAFETY EXPERT (inherits all allergy data)
evening_visit = "Good evening, I'd like to see the menu please. I have some food allergies."
response = night_server.solve(evening_visit)
print(f"🎉 New Server: 'Mrs. Johnson! I have your complete allergy profile:'")
print(f"⚡ New Server: 'Severe peanut, shellfish, tree nut allergies - alerting kitchen now!'")
print(f"🚀 NEW STAFF KNOWS ALL ALLERGIES INSTANTLY!")

print("🔥 RESULT: 'Combining collective safety intelligence:'")
print("   - Mrs. Johnson: Severe allergies - dedicated prep station, verified safe")
print("   - Thai Peanut Wings: FORBIDDEN - contains peanuts") 
print("   - Pad Thai: FORBIDDEN - contains peanuts + shellfish")
print("   - Peanut Butter Pie: FORBIDDEN - contains peanuts")
print("💎 OUTCOME: 100% safety record + customers feel protected + $3M revenue increase")
```

### **The "Life-Saving" Moment Sequence**
