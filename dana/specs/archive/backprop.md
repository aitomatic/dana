# Knowledge Curation as Backpropagation Design

*A backwards-reasoning approach to knowledge organization for agent task optimization*

---

## Core Design Philosophy

The knowledge curation pipeline operates like a backpropagation model, reasoning backwards from desired agent performance to optimal knowledge organization.

### The Analogy

```
Neural Networks:     Input â†’ Forward Pass â†’ Loss â†’ Backprop â†’ Weight Updates
Knowledge Pipeline:  Raw Data â†’ Apply Pipeline â†’ Results â†’ Analysis â†’ Curation Updates
```

### Key Insight

At curation time, we simulate the apply pipeline to predict what knowledge organization will yield the best agent results, then structure our knowledge base accordingly.

## Phase 1: Forward Pass (Curate â†’ Apply â†’ Result)

### Curate Time
**Input**: Raw, heterogeneous knowledge assets
- Company verified data (Trust Tier T1)
- External knowledge packs from Aitomatic (Trust Tier T2)
- Domain specifications and constraints

**Process**: Curation Pipeline
- Structure and synthesize raw knowledge
- Organize into optimal storage configurations
- Create task-specific knowledge artifacts

**Output**: Structured Knowledge Base
- Multi-modal stores (Graph, Vector, RDBMS, KV)
- Trust-tiered and time-bounded knowledge
- Task-optimized indexes and access patterns

### Apply Time
**Input**: Agent task/query + Structured Knowledge Base

**Process**: Apply Pipeline
1. Task profiling and archetype detection
2. Context window assembly from knowledge base
3. Trust-weighted knowledge selection
4. Context optimization for token/latency constraints

**Output**: Optimized context window for agent execution

**Result**: Agent task execution quality (accuracy, efficiency, confidence)

---

## Phase 2: Backward Pass (Result â†’ Curation Optimization)

### Result Analysis
**Metrics Collection**:
- Agent task success rates by domain/archetype
- Context window utilization efficiency
- Knowledge source contribution to successful outcomes
- Latency and computational cost analysis

### Context Window Evaluation
**Assessment Criteria**:
- **Sufficiency**: Did context contain necessary information?
- **Efficiency**: Was context over-provisioned (unused elements)?
- **Coherence**: Were there contradictions or gaps?
- **Trust Distribution**: Optimal T1/T2 ratio for task type?

### Knowledge Base Structure Assessment
**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Storage type effectiveness per task archetype
- Index performance and query pattern alignment
- Knowledge synthesis quality (canonical artifacts)
- Trust tier weighting accuracy

### Curation Strategy Optimization
**Feedback Integration**:
- Adjust storage allocation strategies
- Refine knowledge synthesis rules
- Update trust tier weighting algorithms
- Modify task-to-structure mapping tables

---

## Critical Component: Curation Time Simulation

The curation pipeline must include a **surrogate model** of the apply pipeline to predict optimal knowledge organization.

### Simulation Process

1. **Predict Apply Pipeline Needs**
   - Analyze expected task archetypes for domain
   - Estimate query patterns and context requirements
   - Model agent reasoning pathways

2. **Simulate Context Window Assembly**
   - Test different knowledge organization strategies
   - Predict context window composition for typical tasks
   - Estimate retrieval latency and resource usage

3. **Estimate Result Quality**
   - Score predicted context windows against success criteria
   - Model agent performance with different context configurations
   - Predict accuracy/efficiency trade-offs

4. **Optimize Knowledge Structure**
   - Select best-performing organization strategy
   - Allocate storage resources optimally
   - Configure indexes and access patterns

### Knowledge Structure Search Space
Optimization variables the curation pipeline can control:
- **Storage Type Selection**: Graph vs Vector vs RDBMS vs KV per task archetype
- **Indexing Strategies**: Which relationships/attributes to index
