## 🌟 Usage Examples

### **Basic World Model Usage**
```python
# Initialize agent with world model
agent = MyAgent()
agent.initialize_mind("user123")

# Get current world context
world_state = agent.get_world_context()
print(f"Current time: {world_state.time_context.current_time}")
print(f"Location: {world_state.location_context.city}, {world_state.location_context.country}")
print(f"System health: {world_state.system_context.system_health}")
```

### **Business Logic Integration**
```python
# Use temporal context for decision making
if agent.is_business_hours():
    strategy = "business_hours_strategy"
else:
    strategy = "after_hours_strategy"

# Use system health for resource management
if agent.is_system_healthy():
    max_concurrent_tasks = 5
else:
    max_concurrent_tasks = 1
```

### **Resource Optimization**
```python
# Get optimal concurrency based on system state
concurrency_level = agent.get_optimal_concurrency_level()

# Check if lightweight processing is needed
if agent.should_use_lightweight_processing():
    # Use resource-conservative strategies
    pass
```

### **Localization Support**
```python
# Get localization settings based on location
settings = agent.get_localization_settings()
date_format = settings["date_format"]  # "MM/DD/YYYY" or "DD/MM/YYYY"
time_format = settings["time_format"]  # "12-hour" or "24-hour"
currency = settings["currency"]        # "USD", "EUR", "GBP", etc.
```
