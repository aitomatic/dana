# Prompt Optimization with POET: LLM Performance Excellence

## Use Case Overview

**Industry**: AI/ML Applications and LLM Integration  
**Problem**: LLM prompts require constant optimization for accuracy, cost, and reliability across different contexts  
**POET Value**: Transform basic prompts into self-optimizing LLM interactions with automatic performance improvement

## Business Context

A customer service AI system processes:
- **1000+ customer inquiries daily** across multiple product categories
- **Variable query complexity** from simple FAQs to complex technical issues
- **Cost pressure** ($0.02-0.06 per query, $20-60/day in LLM costs)
- **Accuracy requirements** (>90% response relevance, <5% escalation rate)
- **Response time constraints** (<3 seconds average response time)
- **Context adaptation** (different prompting strategies for different query types)

## Traditional LLM Prompting Challenges

### Before POET Implementation:
```python
# Traditional static prompting approach
def generate_customer_response(query: str, customer_context: dict) -> str:
    # Hard-coded prompt that doesn't adapt to performance
    prompt = f"""
    You are a helpful customer service agent. Answer the customer's question 
    based on the context provided. Be professional and concise.
    
    Customer Context: {customer_context}
    Customer Question: {query}
    
    Response:
    """
    
    # Static LLM call - no optimization
    response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=200)
    return response

# Problems:
# - Generic prompt doesn't adapt to query type or complexity
# - No learning from response quality or customer satisfaction
# - Fixed temperature/token limits regardless of context
# - No cost optimization based on query complexity
# - Manual prompt engineering required for each use case
# - No handling of LLM failures or low-quality responses
```

**Typical Results:**
- **Low Accuracy**: 70-75% response quality due to generic prompting
- **High Costs**: 40% waste on over-prompting simple queries
- **Poor Context Usage**: Misses context clues that could improve responses
- **No Adaptation**: Same prompt template for all query types and complexity levels
- **Manual Maintenance**: Constant prompt tuning needed for evolving customer patterns

## POET Solution: Intelligent LLM Optimization

### What the Engineer Writes (Simple Business Logic)
```python
from opendxa.common.poet.executor import poet
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class CustomerResponse:
    response_text: str
    confidence: float
    query_category: str
    escalation_needed: bool = False

@poet(
    domain="llm_optimization",  # Automatic prompt and parameter optimization
    learning="on"              # Continuous improvement from response quality
)
def generate_customer_response(
    query: str,
    customer_context: dict,
    urgency_level: str = "normal"
) -> CustomerResponse:
    """
    Generate customer service response with POET intelligent optimization.
    
    Simple response generation logic - POET handles prompt optimization,
    parameter tuning, cost management, and quality assurance automatically.
    """
    
    # Simple query categorization (POET will enhance this)
    if any(word in query.lower() for word in ['refund', 'cancel', 'problem']):
        category = "complaint"
    elif any(word in query.lower() for word in ['how', 'what', 'when', 'where']):
        category = "question"
    else:
        category = "general"
    
    # Basic prompt construction (POET will optimize this)
    prompt = f"""
    Customer Question: {query}
    Context: {customer_context.get('product', 'general')}
    Category: {category}
    
    Provide a helpful response:
    """
    
    # Simple LLM call (POET will optimize parameters)
    response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=200)
    
    # Basic confidence estimation (POET will enhance this)
    confidence = 0.8 if len(response) > 50 else 0.6
    
    return CustomerResponse(
        response_text=response,
        confidence=confidence,
        query_category=category,
        escalation_needed=confidence < 0.7
    )
```

### What POET Runtime Provides Automatically (No Code Written)

#### **Perceive Stage (Automatic Prompt Intelligence)**
```python
# POET automatically handles:
# ✅ Query complexity analysis (adjusts prompting strategy by complexity)
# ✅ Context relevance filtering (includes only useful context to reduce costs)
# ✅ Intent detection enhancement (improves categorization beyond basic keywords)
# ✅ Historical pattern matching (applies learned strategies for similar queries)
# ✅ Token budget optimization (balances prompt length with output quality)
# ✅ Multi-step reasoning detection (identifies queries needing chain-of-thought)

# Example automatic enhancements applied by POET:
enhanced_inputs = {
    "original_query": "My widget stopped working after the update",
    "customer_context": {"product": "WidgetPro", "tier": "premium", "history": "3_issues"},
    "urgency_level": "normal",
    
    # POET automatically adds optimizations:
    "query_complexity": 0.7,        # Medium complexity detected
    "intent_classification": {
        "primary": "technical_issue",
        "secondary": "update_related",
        "confidence": 0.92
    },
    "relevant_context": {           # Filtered to most relevant context
        "product": "WidgetPro",
        "version": "v2.1.3",        # Auto-extracted from update mention
        "known_issues": ["update_bug_301"],  # Retrieved from knowledge base
        "customer_tier": "premium"   # Priority handling
    },
    "prompt_strategy": "step_by_step_troubleshooting",  # Learned optimal approach
    "token_budget": {"input": 150, "output": 300},      # Optimized for this complexity
    "examples_to_include": 1        # Include 1 similar example for better performance
}
```

#### **Enforce Stage (Automatic Quality & Cost Control)**
```python
# POET automatically provides:
# ✅ Response quality validation (ensures responses meet accuracy standards)
# ✅ Relevance checking (validates response addresses the actual query)
# ✅ Tone and style consistency (maintains brand voice across responses)
# ✅ Cost efficiency validation (ensures optimal cost/quality ratio)
# ✅ Safety and appropriateness checking (prevents harmful or off-topic responses)
# ✅ Escalation logic (automatically identifies when human handoff is needed)

# Example automatic validation and enhancement:
{
    "original_response": "I can help with that. Try restarting the widget and check if the issue persists.",
    "poet_optimized_response": {
        "response_text": "I understand your WidgetPro stopped working after the recent update. This is a known issue with v2.1.3. Here's how to resolve it:\n\n1. Restart your WidgetPro device\n2. Check if you're on firmware v2.1.3 (Settings > About)\n3. If the issue persists, we can process a priority replacement under your premium warranty.\n\nWould you like me to start the replacement process or try a manual firmware rollback first?",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "query_category": "technical_issue_known",
        "escalation_needed": False
    },
    "quality_validations": {
        "addresses_query": True,
        "actionable_steps": True,
        "appropriate_tone": True,
        "includes_next_steps": True,
        "leverages_customer_tier": True
    },
    "cost_optimization": {
        "token_efficiency": 0.89,      # High efficiency - good value per token
        "estimated_cost": "$0.018",    # Below target of $0.025
        "complexity_match": True       # Appropriate response for query complexity
    }
}
```

#### **Train Stage (Automatic Prompt Learning)**
```python
# POET automatically learns and optimizes:
# ✅ Optimal prompting strategies for different query types
# ✅ Parameter tuning (temperature, max_tokens) based on actual performance
# ✅ Context selection optimization (what context actually improves responses)
# ✅ Cost-quality tradeoffs (when to use more/fewer tokens)
# ✅ Customer satisfaction correlation with response characteristics
# ✅ Seasonal and trending topic adaptation

### **Learning in Action: Query Type Optimization**
```python
# MONTH 1: Engineer deploys simple prompting function
query_data = {
    "query": "I can't log into my account and I need to access my billing",
    "customer_context": {"product": "BusinessPlan", "tier": "enterprise"},
    "urgency_level": "high"
}

# - Login issues + billing urgency = needs immediate escalation path
# - Enterprise customers expect specific SLA acknowledgment
# - This query type has 89% success rate with step-by-step approach
# - Including direct contact info reduces follow-up queries by 67%

# POET runtime now constructs optimized prompt:
learned_prompt_strategy = {
    "query_type": "account_access_with_billing_urgency",
    "customer_tier": "enterprise",
    "optimal_approach": "immediate_resolution_with_escalation_path",

# Cost: $0.019 per query (58% reduction), Response Quality: 0.91 (17% improvement)

# POET learned that less context can mean better responses when context is relevant
```

## Usage Examples

### **Simple Function Call (Enhanced Automatically)**
```python
# Engineer calls the function normally - POET optimization applied automatically
result = generate_customer_response(
    query="My premium subscription isn't working after the latest app update",
    customer_context={"product": "PremiumApp", "tier": "premium", "version": "3.2.1"},
    urgency_level="high"
)

# Returns optimized response:
# CustomerResponse(
#     response_text="I can see you're experiencing issues with PremiumApp v3.2.1...",
#     confidence=0.94,
#     query_category="technical_issue_app_update",
#     escalation_needed=False
# )
```

### **Dynamic Optimization (POET Handles Automatically)**
```python
# POET automatically adapts prompting strategy based on:
# - Query complexity and type
# - Customer tier and history
# - Time of day and support load
# - Recent response success patterns
# - Cost efficiency targets

# Morning rush hour: More concise responses to handle volume
# Evening: More detailed responses when support load is lower
# Technical queries: Step-by-step approach with examples
# Billing issues: Empathetic tone with specific resolution paths
# Premium customers: Enhanced service level acknowledgment
```

## Key POET Design Principles Demonstrated

### **1. Minimal Code, Maximum Intelligence**
- **8 lines** of business logic vs **200+ lines** for custom prompt optimization
- Engineer focuses on **response generation logic**, POET handles optimization
- **No custom prompt engineering, parameter tuning, or quality validation code needed**

### **2. Domain Intelligence Built-In**
- `domain="llm_optimization"` provides automatic prompt and parameter optimization
- Pre-built understanding of LLM behavior, cost optimization, quality validation
- **No need to research prompt engineering techniques or LLM parameter tuning**

### **3. Automatic Learning Without ML Expertise**
- System improves from **72% to 94%** response quality without engineer involvement
- **Automatic prompt strategy optimization** based on actual customer satisfaction
- **Cost-quality optimization** happens transparently to the application developer

### **4. Quality and Cost Control by Default**
- **Quality validation, cost optimization, safety screening** - all automatic
- **Response monitoring, escalation logic, performance tracking** - built into runtime
- **Brand consistency, tone validation, appropriateness checking** - handled by domain profile

## **The POET Promise: Simple Prompts, Intelligent LLM Interactions**

```python
# What engineer writes (response generation only):
@poet(domain="llm_optimization", learning="on")
def generate_customer_response(query: str, customer_context: dict, 
                             urgency_level: str = "normal") -> CustomerResponse:
    # Simple categorization
    category = categorize_query(query)
    
    # Basic prompt
    prompt = f"Customer Question: {query}\nContext: {customer_context}\nResponse:"
    
    # Simple LLM call
    response = llm.generate(prompt, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=200)
    
    return CustomerResponse(response, 0.8, category)

# What application gets automatically:
# ✅ Query complexity analysis and optimal prompting strategies
# ✅ Context relevance filtering and token budget optimization
# ✅ Parameter tuning (temperature, tokens) based on query type
# ✅ Response quality validation and improvement suggestions
# ✅ Cost efficiency optimization and budget management
# ✅ Continuous learning from customer satisfaction
# ✅ Safety screening and content appropriateness checking
# ✅ Escalation logic and human handoff management
```

**This is the essence of POET applied to LLM optimization: Transform basic prompts into intelligent, adaptive AI interactions with minimal configuration and zero prompt engineering expertise required.**
