# CORRAL Operations Specification

## Operation Lifecycle Overview

The CORRAL framework implements six core operations that form a complete knowledge lifecycle. Each operation has specific responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and integration points with the Dana architecture.

```
Problem → CURATE → ORGANIZE → RETRIEVE → REASON → ACT → LEARN → Enhanced Knowledge
           ↑                                                         ↓
           ←←←←←←←←←←←←← Feedback Loop ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

## 1. CURATE (Input/Acquisition)

### Purpose
Gather, filter, and prepare raw information for transformation into structured knowledge.

### Input Sources
- **Agent Interactions**: User queries, agent responses, conversation context
- **Workflow Execution**: Process steps, intermediate results, final outcomes
- **External Resources**: Documentation, APIs, databases, knowledge bases  
- **Environmental Observation**: System states, environmental changes, context shifts
- **User Feedback**: Explicit corrections, satisfaction ratings, preference updates

### Curation Strategies

#### Automatic Curation
```python
def curate_from_interaction(self, user_query: str, agent_response: str, outcome: Outcome) -> CurationResult:
    """Extract knowledge from successful agent interactions"""
    
def curate_from_workflow(self, workflow_execution: WorkflowExecution) -> CurationResult:
    """Learn from workflow success patterns and failure modes"""
    
def curate_from_resource(self, resource: Resource, access_context: Context) -> CurationResult:
    """Extract knowledge from resource interactions and updates"""
```

#### Active Curation
```python
def identify_knowledge_gaps(self, problem_context: ProblemContext) -> List[KnowledgeGap]:
    """Identify missing knowledge needed for current problem"""
    
def request_clarification(self, ambiguous_knowledge: Knowledge) -> ClarificationRequest:
    """Ask targeted questions to resolve knowledge ambiguity"""
    
def validate_uncertain_knowledge(self, uncertain_knowledge: Knowledge) -> ValidationRequest:
    """Seek confirmation for low-confidence knowledge"""
```

### Quality Filters
- **Relevance Scoring**: Filter based on problem domain and context
- **Source Credibility**: Weight by source reliability and authority
- **Recency Weighting**: Prefer newer information, decay old knowledge
- **Consistency Checking**: Flag contradictory information for resolution

### Output
- **Raw Knowledge Items**: Unprocessed but filtered information
- **Metadata**: Source, timestamp, confidence, context
- **Quality Scores**: Relevance, credibility, completeness ratings
- **Processing Recommendations**: Suggested categorization and organization

## 2. ORGANIZE (Structure/Storage)

### Purpose
Transform raw knowledge into structured, categorized, and indexed form for efficient storage and retrieval.

### Organization Architecture

#### Primary Categorization
```python
class KnowledgeOrganizer:
    def categorize_knowledge(self, raw_knowledge: RawKnowledge) -> CategorizedKnowledge:
        """Assign knowledge to primary categories (Declarative, Procedural, etc.)"""
        
    def create_cross_references(self, knowledge_item: Knowledge) -> List[CrossReference]:
        """Establish relationships with existing knowledge"""
        
    def generate_embeddings(self, knowledge_item: Knowledge) -> Vector:
        """Create semantic embeddings for similarity matching"""
```

#### Multi-Dimensional Indexing
- **Category Index**: Primary classification (Declarative, Procedural, Causal, Relational, Conditional)
- **Domain Index**: Subject area clustering (software_dev, business_ops, etc.)
- **Confidence Index**: Reliability-based groupings
- **Recency Index**: Time-based organization for temporal relevance
- **Usage Index**: Access frequency for performance optimization
- **Context Index**: Situational applicability clustering

#### Storage Strategy
```python
class KnowledgeStorage:
    def store_with_versioning(self, knowledge: Knowledge) -> StorageResult:
        """Store with full version history"""
        
    def create_relationships(self, knowledge: Knowledge, related_items: List[Knowledge]) -> None:
        """Establish bidirectional relationships"""
        
    def optimize_storage(self, usage_patterns: UsagePatterns) -> None:
        """Reorganize based on access patterns"""
```

### Graph Database Schema
```python
# Nodes: Knowledge items with category, properties, confidence
# Edges: Relationships with type, strength, directionality
# Indices: Multi-dimensional for fast query performance
# Temporal: Version history and time-based decay
```

### Output
- **Structured Knowledge Graph**: Organized, indexed, and cross-referenced
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Vector representations for similarity matching
- **Relationship Maps**: Connections between knowledge items
- **Storage Metadata**: Location, access patterns, optimization hints

## 3. RETRIEVE (Query/Access)

### Purpose
Efficiently find and return relevant knowledge based on query context and current problem needs.

### Retrieval Strategies

#### Context-Aware Retrieval
```python
def retrieve_for_problem(self, problem_context: ProblemContext) -> RetrievalResult:
    """Get knowledge relevant to current problem"""
    
def retrieve_by_similarity(self, query_vector: Vector, threshold: float) -> List[Knowledge]:
    """Semantic similarity-based retrieval"""
    
def retrieve_connected(self, seed_knowledge: Knowledge, max_depth: int) -> KnowledgeSubgraph:
    """Graph traversal for connected knowledge"""
```

#### Multi-Modal Queries
- **Category-Specific**: "Give me procedural knowledge about deployments"
- **Cross-Category**: "Why does this workflow fail?" (Causal + Procedural)
- **Contextual**: "What worked in similar situations?" (Conditional + Historical)
- **Analogical**: "Find situations similar to current context"

#### Ranking and Filtering
```python
class RetrievalRanker:
    def rank_by_relevance(self, candidates: List[Knowledge], context: Context) -> List[RankedKnowledge]:
        """Score knowledge by problem relevance"""
        
    def filter_by_confidence(self, candidates: List[Knowledge], min_confidence: float) -> List[Knowledge]:
        """Remove low-confidence knowledge"""
        
    def apply_recency_decay(self, candidates: List[Knowledge]) -> List[Knowledge]:
        """Weight by knowledge freshness"""
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Hot Cache**: Frequently accessed knowledge in memory
- **Warm Cache**: Recently used knowledge with fast SSD access
- **Cold Storage**: Archived knowledge with lazy loading
- **Predictive Caching**: Pre-load knowledge likely to be needed

### Output
- **Ranked Knowledge Set**: Relevant knowledge sorted by importance
- **Confidence Scores**: Reliability ratings for each item
- **Relationship Context**: How retrieved items connect to each other
- **Retrieval Metadata**: Query performance, cache hits, completeness

## 4. REASON (Inference/Analysis)
