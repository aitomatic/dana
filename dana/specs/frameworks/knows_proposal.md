## Knowledge Type Architecture

### Two Fundamental Knowledge Types
The system recognizes and processes two fundamental types of knowledge:

#### 1. Topical Knowledge (WHAT)
**Definition**: Knowledge about the subject matter, concepts, facts, and information
**Characteristics**:
- Describes what things are, their properties, and characteristics
- Contains factual information, definitions, and conceptual understanding
- Answers "what" questions about the domain
- Provides context and background information

**Examples**:
- Technical specifications and parameters
- Product features and capabilities
- Error code definitions and meanings
- Hardware component descriptions
- System architecture overviews

#### 2. Procedural Knowledge (HOW)
**Definition**: Knowledge about processes, workflows, and step-by-step procedures
**Characteristics**:
- Describes how to perform tasks and solve problems
- Contains step-by-step instructions and workflows
- Answers "how" questions about processes
- Provides actionable guidance and procedures

**Examples**:
- Troubleshooting procedures and diagnostic steps
- Configuration and setup instructions
- Installation and deployment workflows
- Maintenance and repair procedures
- Problem-solving methodologies

### Knowledge Type Processing
- **Classification**: Each piece of knowledge is classified as either topical or procedural during extraction
- **Storage**: Knowledge is organized and stored separately by type for efficient retrieval
- **Retrieval**: Users can search for specific knowledge types or get mixed results with type distinction
- **Application**: Different knowledge types serve different purposes in problem-solving scenarios

### Knowledge Item Structure
Each knowledge item contains the following fields:

#### Meta Knowledge Items (Meta Knowledge Bank)
```json
{
  "knowledge": "Description of the knowledge content",
  "type": "topical" | "procedural"
}
```

#### Documentary Knowledge Items (Documentary Knowledge Store)
```json
{
  "meta_knowledge": "Original meta knowledge that was processed",
  "knowledge": "Detailed, structured knowledge extracted from documents",
  "knowledge_type": "topical" | "procedural",
  "type": "Documentary Knowledge"
}
```

#### Synthesized Knowledge Items (Synthesized Knowledge Store)
```json
{
  "meta_knowledge": "Original meta knowledge that was processed",
  "knowledge": "Comprehensive knowledge synthesized when document retrieval was insufficient",
  "knowledge_type": "topical" | "procedural", 
  "type": "Synthesized Knowledge"
}
```

### Field Descriptions
- **knowledge**: The actual knowledge content (string) - used for agent context
- **type**: For meta knowledge, indicates "topical" or "procedural"
- **knowledge_type**: For documentary/synthesized knowledge, preserves the original type classification
- **meta_knowledge**: Reference to the original meta knowledge item that was processed - used for knowledge search
- **type**: For documentary/synthesized knowledge, indicates the knowledge creation method ("Documentary Knowledge" or "Synthesized Knowledge")

### Search and Context Usage
- **Knowledge Search**: Performed using the `meta_knowledge` field for efficient semantic matching
- **Agent Context**: The `knowledge` field provides detailed, structured content for agent problem-solving
- **Search Efficiency**: Using meta_knowledge for search reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy
- **Context Quality**: The knowledge field contains comprehensive, AI-optimized content for agent decision-making

**Rationale**: LLMs provide superior understanding of technical content and can generate structured knowledge
**Consequences**: Higher cost, dependency on external API, but superior quality

### ADR-002: Dual Knowledge Creation Strategy
**Context**: Some knowledge requires document retrieval, others need synthesis
**Decision**: Implement both documentary and synthesized knowledge creation
**Rationale**: Ensures comprehensive knowledge coverage even when documents are insufficient
**Consequences**: More complex processing but better knowledge completeness

### ADR-003: Local Vector Storage
**Context**: Need efficient document retrieval without external dependencies
**Decision**: Use local JSON-based vector storage with LlamaIndex
**Rationale**: Simple deployment, no external database dependencies, sufficient for current scale
**Consequences**: Limited scalability but simplified architecture

### ADR-004: Parallel Processing with Limits
**Context**: Need to process many knowledge items efficiently
**Decision**: Use ThreadPoolExecutor with limited workers (4 max)
**Rationale**: Balances performance with API rate limits and system stability
**Consequences**: Controlled resource usage but limited throughput
