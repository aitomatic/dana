## Overview

POET (Perceive-Operate-Enforce-Train) is an LLM-powered code generation framework that transforms simple functions into production-ready implementations. Using advanced language models to understand code intent and context, POET generates intelligent enhancements that go far beyond pattern matching.

### Vision
Enable developers to write simple functions and get enterprise-grade reliability, monitoring, and continuous improvement automatically through AI-powered code generation.

### Core Promise
"Your AI pair programmer that makes every function production-ready."

## Core Innovation: LLM-Powered Code Generation

### The Problem with Templates
Traditional code enhancement tools use templates and pattern matching:
- Can only detect surface patterns (like "/" for division)
- Generate generic, one-size-fits-all enhancements
- Miss the semantic meaning and intent of code
- Cannot adapt to specific contexts or requirements

### The POET Solution: AI Understanding
POET uses LLMs to deeply understand your code:
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understands what your function actually does
- **Context Awareness**: Uses docstrings, variable names, and patterns
- **Domain Intelligence**: Applies specialized knowledge per domain
- **Custom Generation**: Creates enhancements specific to each function
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves from feedback over time

### Example: The Power of Understanding

```python
# Your simple function
@poet(domain="mathematical_operations")
def calculate_compound_interest(principal: float, rate: float, years: int) -> float:
    """Calculate compound interest for investment."""
    return principal * (1 + rate) ** years
```

**Template-based approach would generate**:
- Generic numeric validation
- Basic division by zero check (not even relevant)

**LLM-powered POET generates**:
- Validates rate is a reasonable percentage (0-1 or 0-100)
- Checks principal is positive (negative investment doesn't make sense)
- Ensures years is positive integer
- Warns if result suggests unrealistic returns
- Adds financial rounding appropriate for currency
- Handles edge cases like very long time periods

## User Experience

### The POET Journey

#### 1. **Write Natural Code**
```python
def process_payment(amount: float, card_number: str) -> dict:
    """Process credit card payment."""
    return {"status": "success", "amount": amount}
```

#### 2. **Add POET Decorator**
```python
@poet(domain="financial", optimize_for="security")
def process_payment(amount: float, card_number: str) -> dict:
    """Process credit card payment."""
    return {"status": "success", "amount": amount}
```

#### 3. **AI Analyzes and Enhances**
POET's LLM understands this is a payment function and generates:
- PCI compliance validation
- Card number format checking (Luhn algorithm)
- Amount validation (positive, reasonable limits)
- Retry logic for payment gateway failures
- Audit logging for compliance
- Fraud detection signals

#### 4. **Transparent Enhancement**
Generated code is saved locally in `.dana/poet/process_payment.na`:
```dana
def perceive(amount: float, card_number: string, state: POETState) -> POETState {
    # LLM understands this is payment processing
    
    # Validate amount
    if amount <= 0 {
        state.errors.append("Payment amount must be positive")
    }
    if amount > 10000 {  # Business rule for fraud prevention
        state.warnings.append("Large transaction requires additional verification")
    }
    
    # Validate card number format and checksum
    if not is_valid_card_format(card_number) {
        state.errors.append("Invalid card number format")
    }
    if not luhn_check(card_number) {
        state.errors.append("Card number failed validation")
    }
    
    # Security: mask card number in logs
    state.metadata["masked_card"] = mask_card_number(card_number)
    
    return state
}
```
