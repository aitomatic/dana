Documents are organized by category in subdirectories. Each document header indicates status: **Complete** (implemented), **Implementation** (in progress), **Design** (proposal), **Example** (use cases), or **Deprecated** (outdated). Look for `*_impl.md` files for implementation details and `*_example.md` files for usage examples. Use `templates/design_document_template.md` for new specifications.
