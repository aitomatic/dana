# Struct Methods Design - Dana Core Language Enhancement

## Overview

This directory contains the design documents for implementing **explicit receiver syntax with union type support** for struct methods in Dana. This enhancement replaces the current implicit struct method resolution with a Go-inspired explicit receiver syntax.

## Problem Statement

Currently, Dana uses implicit struct method resolution where `some_struct.some_func()` is transformed into `some_func(some_struct, ...)` at runtime. This approach has several limitations:

1. **Inefficient Lookup**: Searches multiple scopes (registry, local, private, public, system)
2. **No Compile-Time Validation**: Errors only discovered at runtime
3. **Limited Expressiveness**: Can't easily express methods that work with multiple struct types
4. **Complex Transformation Logic**: Hidden syntactic sugar makes debugging difficult

## Goals

**Brief Description**: Implement explicit receiver syntax for struct methods with union type support to provide compile-time validation, better performance, and enhanced expressiveness.

- **Compile-Time Validation**: Method existence and type compatibility checked at parse time
- **Performance Improvement**: O(1) method resolution instead of scope searching
- **Union Type Support**: Methods can operate on multiple struct types using `|` syntax
- **Clear Intent**: Explicit declaration of which structs a method operates on
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single, predictable method resolution strategy
- **Go-Inspired Syntax**: Familiar receiver syntax for developers coming from Go

**Success Criteria**:
- All method calls resolve at compile time with clear error messages
- Performance at least as good as current implicit system
- Union type methods work correctly with type checking
- No regressions in existing Dana functionality

## Non-Goals

**Brief Description**: Explicitly state what we won't implement to avoid scope creep and maintain focus.

- **Method Overloading**: We won't support multiple methods with same name but different signatures
- **Inheritance**: We won't implement method inheritance or virtual dispatch
- **Generic Methods**: We won't support generic/template methods beyond union types
- **Method Chaining**: We won't implement fluent interfaces or method chaining
- **Backward Compatibility**: We won't maintain support for implicit method resolution
- **Dynamic Method Addition**: We won't support adding methods to structs at runtime
- **Method Decorators**: We won't implement method decorators or annotations
- **Complex Type Constraints**: We won't support complex type constraints beyond union types

## KISS/YAGNI Analysis

**Brief Description**: Justify complexity vs simplicity choices based on immediate needs.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principles Applied

**Simple Receiver Syntax**: `def (receiver: Type) method_name(...)` is the simplest possible syntax that clearly indicates the receiver type.

**Union Types Only**: Using `|` for union types leverages existing Dana type system without adding complex type constraint syntax.

**Direct Method Registration**: Methods register directly with struct types rather than complex method tables or inheritance hierarchies.

**Single Resolution Strategy**: One way to resolve methods (direct lookup) instead of multiple fallback strategies.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) Decisions

**No Method Overloading**: Current Dana codebase doesn't use method overloading, so we don't need it.

**No Inheritance**: Dana's struct system is composition-based, not inheritance-based.

**No Generic Methods**: Union types provide sufficient polymorphism for current use cases.

**No Method Decorators**: No existing patterns in Dana codebase require method decorators.

**No Dynamic Method Addition**: All methods are defined at parse time, no runtime method addition needed.

### Complexity Justification

**Parser Changes**: Required to support new syntax, but kept minimal with simple grammar rules.

**AST Modifications**: Necessary to represent receiver syntax, but follows existing patterns.

**Type System Integration**: Required for union type support, but leverages existing type system.

**Method Registration**: Required for compile-time validation, but simple direct registration.

## Core Concept

Replace implicit method resolution with **explicit receiver syntax**:

```dana
# Before: Implicit (runtime transformation)
def translate(point: Point, dx: int, dy: int) -> Point:
    return Point(x=point.x + dx, y=point.y + dy)

# After: Explicit (compile-time resolution)
def (point: Point) translate(dx: int, dy: int) -> Point:
    return Point(x=point.x + dx, y=point.y + dy)

# With union type support
def (shape: Point | Circle | Rectangle) area() -> float:
    if isinstance(shape, Point):
        return 0.0
    elif isinstance(shape, Circle):
        return 3.14159 * shape.radius * shape.radius
    elif isinstance(shape, Rectangle):
        return shape.width * shape.height
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Compile-Time Validation**: Method existence and type compatibility checked at parse time
2. **Direct Method Resolution**: O(1) lookup from method table, no scope searching
3. **Union Type Support**: Methods can operate on multiple struct types
4. **Clear Intent**: Explicit declaration of which structs a method operates on
5. **Better Performance**: No runtime transformation or scope searching
6. **Simpler Architecture**: One way to define and resolve methods

## Success Criteria

1. **Compile-Time Errors**: Method existence validated at parse time
2. **Union Type Support**: Methods can operate on multiple struct types
3. **Performance**: O(1) method resolution
4. **Expressiveness**: Clear, readable method declarations
5. **Consistency**: Single, predictable method resolution strategy
