# Objective-Driven State Machine Agent

## Overview

This design implements an **Objective-Driven State Machine** using Dana's POET (Perceive-Operate-Enforce-Train) architecture. The system demonstrates how to create agents with explicit objectives and optimization targets for each function, orchestrated through a well-defined state machine.

## Architecture

### Core Concepts

1. **Objective-Driven Functions**: Every function has:
   - **Domain**: Context for domain-specific intelligence (e.g., "semiconductor")
   - **Objective**: Clear purpose stating what the function aims to achieve
   - **Optimize For**: Specific target like "accuracy", "speed", "reliability", or "efficiency"

2. **State Machine Pattern**: 6-phase execution cycle:
   ```
   IDLE → ANALYZING → DIAGNOSING → OPTIMIZING → VALIDATING → REPORTING → IDLE
   ```

3. **POET Integration**: Each function leverages the 4-phase POET pipeline:
   - **Perceive**: Input validation and context preparation
   - **Operate**: Core business logic execution
   - **Enforce**: Output validation and quality assurance
   - **Train**: Metrics collection for continuous improvement

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced POET Decorator

The `objective_poet` decorator extends the standard POET decorator with:

```dana
@objective_poet(
    domain="semiconductor",
    objective="analyze process parameters for anomalies",
    optimize_for="accuracy"
)
def analyze_process_data(agent: ObjectiveDrivenAgent, data: ProcessDataBatch) -> dict:
    # Function implementation
```

### 2. Data Structures

Domain-specific types for semiconductor manufacturing:

- `ProcessParameter`: Individual sensor measurements
- `ProcessAnomaly`: Detected anomalies with severity and recommendations
- `OptimizationRecommendation`: Parameter optimization suggestions
- `ProcessHealthReport`: Comprehensive analysis results
- `StateMachineContext`: Execution state and history tracking

### 3. State Machine Functions

Each function represents a state in the execution cycle:

1. **analyze_process_data**: Analyzes parameters for patterns and anomalies
2. **diagnose_anomalies**: Performs root cause analysis
3. **optimize_parameters**: Generates optimization recommendations
4. **validate_optimizations**: Validates recommendations for safety
5. **generate_report**: Creates comprehensive health report
6. **execute_state_machine**: Orchestrates the complete cycle

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```dana
# Create an objective-driven agent
agent = ObjectiveDrivenAgent(
    name="ProcessControlAgent",
    description="Semiconductor process optimization"
)

# Set process specifications
agent.set_process_specs({
    "temperature": {"min": 340.0, "max": 360.0, "target": 350.0},
    "pressure": {"min": 95.0, "max": 105.0, "target": 100.0}
})

# Execute state machine with process data
report = execute_state_machine(agent, process_data)

# Check results
log(f"Process Health: {report.overall_health:.1%}")
log(f"Anomalies: {len(report.anomalies_detected)}")
log(f"Optimizations: {len(report.optimizations)}")
```

### Individual State Execution

```dana
# Execute individual states for testing
analysis = analyze_process_data(agent, data)
diagnosis = diagnose_anomalies(agent, analysis)
optimization = optimize_parameters(agent, diagnosis)
validation = validate_optimizations(agent, optimization)
report = generate_report(agent, validation, analysis, diagnosis)
```

### Custom Objectives

```dana
@objective_poet(
    domain="semiconductor",
    objective="minimize parameter drift",
    optimize_for="stability"
)
def custom_drift_analysis(agent: ObjectiveDrivenAgent, data: ProcessDataBatch) -> dict:
    agent.current_state = ProcessState.ANALYZING
    # Custom analysis logic focused on drift detection
```

## Design Patterns

### 1. Objective Tracking

Each function sets the agent's current objective:

```dana
agent.current_objective = "analyze process parameters for anomalies"
agent.objective_status = "in_progress"
# ... perform work ...
agent.objective_status = "completed"
```

### 2. State Management

State transitions are tracked in the context:

```dana
agent.context.add_state_transition(ProcessState.ANALYZING)
# This updates current_state, previous_state, and state_history
```

### 3. Metrics Collection

Functions collect metrics for learning:

```dana
agent.collect_metrics({
    "objective": objective,
    "optimize_for": optimize_for,
    "success": True,
    "duration": execution_time,
    "timestamp": time.now()
})
```

## Domain Intelligence

### Semiconductor-Specific Features

1. **Parameter Correlation Detection**: Identifies coupled parameters (e.g., temperature-power)
2. **Drift Analysis**: Detects systematic parameter drift over time
3. **Variability Assessment**: Uses coefficient of variation for stability analysis
4. **Safety Margins**: Applies safety factors to optimization recommendations

### Statistical Methods

- **Trend Detection**: Linear regression for identifying increasing/decreasing trends
- **Anomaly Severity**: Multi-level classification based on deviation magnitude
- **Optimization Ranking**: Priority scoring based on impact and confidence

## Best Practices

### 1. Objective Definition

- Be specific and measurable in objectives
- Align objectives with business goals
- Choose appropriate optimization targets

### 2. Error Handling

- Each state function should handle errors gracefully
- Failed objectives should update agent status
- State machine should transition to ERROR state on failures

### 3. Optimization Safety

- Always validate recommendations against safety limits
- Apply safety factors to prevent aggressive optimizations
- Check for conflicting optimizations

### 4. Learning Integration

- Enable metrics collection for continuous improvement
- Track success rates and execution times
- Use historical data to improve future decisions

## Extension Points

### 1. Custom Domains

Create domain plugins for other industries:

```dana
@objective_poet(
    domain="healthcare",
    objective="diagnose patient symptoms",
    optimize_for="accuracy"
)
```

### 2. Additional States

Extend the state machine with new phases:

```dana
enum ProcessState:
    # ... existing states ...
    SIMULATING = "simulating"
    PREDICTING = "predicting"
```

### 3. Advanced Optimization

Implement sophisticated optimization algorithms:

- Multi-objective optimization
- Constraint-based optimization
- Machine learning-based recommendations

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Test individual functions with mock data:

```dana
def test_analyze_anomalies():
    agent = ObjectiveDrivenAgent("TestAgent")
    test_data = create_test_batch_with_anomalies()
    result = analyze_process_data(agent, test_data)
    assert result["anomaly_count"] > 0
```

### Integration Tests

Test complete state machine execution:

```dana
def test_full_cycle():
    agent = create_configured_agent()
    data = generate_realistic_data()
    report = execute_state_machine(agent, data)
    assert report.overall_health >= 0.0
    assert agent.current_state == ProcessState.IDLE
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Batch Processing**: Process parameters in batches for efficiency
2. **Caching**: Cache statistical calculations when possible
3. **Parallel Analysis**: Consider parallel execution for independent analyses
4. **Memory Management**: Limit metric history to prevent memory growth

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing for continuous monitoring
2. **Distributed Execution**: Scale across multiple agents
3. **Advanced Learning**: Implement reinforcement learning for optimization
4. **Visualization**: Add real-time dashboards and alerts
5. **Integration**: Connect with actual manufacturing systems

## Conclusion

This objective-driven state machine design provides a robust framework for building intelligent agents that can analyze, diagnose, optimize, and report on complex processes. The combination of explicit objectives, POET architecture, and domain intelligence creates a system that is both powerful and maintainable.
