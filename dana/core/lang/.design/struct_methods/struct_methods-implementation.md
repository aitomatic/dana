## Design Review Status
- [x] **Problem Alignment**: Does solution address all stated problems?
- [x] **Goal Achievement**: Will implementation meet all success criteria?
- [x] **Non-Goal Compliance**: Are we staying within defined scope?
- [x] **KISS/YAGNI Compliance**: Is complexity justified by immediate needs?
- [ ] **Security review completed**
- [ ] **Performance impact assessed**
- [ ] **Error handling comprehensive**
- [ ] **Testing strategy defined**
- [ ] **Documentation planned**
- [ ] **Backwards compatibility checked**

## Implementation Progress
**Overall Progress**: [ ] 0% | [ ] 20% | [x] 40% | [ ] 60% | [ ] 80% | [ ] 100%

### Phase 1: Grammar and Parser (100%)
- [x] Update `dana_grammar.lark` with method definition syntax
- [x] Create `MethodDef` AST node in `ast.py`
- [x] Update `statement_transformer.py` to handle method definitions
- [x] Support union type parsing in receiver position
- [x] Create test file `test_phase1_parser.na`
- [x] **Phase Gate**: Run tests - ALL tests pass (parser successfully creates AST nodes)
- [x] **Phase Gate**: Update implementation progress checkboxes

### Phase 2: Method Registration (100%)
- [x] Create `MethodRegistry` class in `struct_system.py`
- [x] Integrate registry with `StructTypeRegistry`
- [x] Update function executor to register methods
- [x] Validate receiver types at registration
- [x] Handle union type expansion
- [x] Create test file `test_phase2_registry.na`
- [x] **Phase Gate**: Run tests - ALL tests pass (methods register correctly)
- [x] **Phase Gate**: Update implementation progress checkboxes

### Phase 3: Runtime Execution (0%)
- [ ] Update method call executor in `expression_executor.py`
- [ ] Implement direct registry lookup
- [ ] Add proper error messages for missing methods
- [ ] Remove old scope-based method lookup
- [ ] Create test file `test_phase3_runtime.na`
- [ ] **Phase Gate**: Run tests - ALL tests pass
- [ ] **Phase Gate**: Update implementation progress checkboxes

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Optimization (0%)
- [ ] Remove implicit transformation code
- [ ] Add deprecation warnings for old style
- [ ] Optimize method lookup performance
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create migration examples
- [ ] **Phase Gate**: Run tests - ALL tests pass
- [ ] **Phase Gate**: Update implementation progress checkboxes

### Phase 5: Integration Testing (0%)
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Memory usage analysis
- [ ] **Phase Gate**: All metrics meet targets

### Phase 6: Documentation and Examples (0%)
- [ ] Create comprehensive examples
- [ ] Update language reference
- [ ] Write migration guide
- [ ] Create tutorial
- [ ] **Phase Gate**: Documentation complete

## Quality Gates
⚠️  DO NOT proceed to next phase until ALL criteria met:
- ✅ 100% test pass rate - ZERO failures allowed
- ✅ No regressions detected in existing functionality
- ✅ Error handling complete and tested with failure scenarios
- ✅ Examples created and validated (Phase 6 only)
- ✅ Documentation updated and cites working examples (Phase 6 only)
- ✅ Performance within defined bounds
- ✅ Implementation progress checkboxes updated
- ✅ Design review completed (if in Phase 1)

## Technical Debt & Maintenance
- [ ] **Code Analysis**: Run automated analysis tools
- [ ] **Complexity Review**: Assess code complexity metrics
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Verify test coverage targets
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update technical documentation
- [ ] **Performance**: Validate performance metrics
- [ ] **Security**: Complete security review

## Recent Updates
- 2025-01-28: Created design document and implementation tracker
- 2025-01-28: Starting Phase 1 implementation
- 2025-01-28: Completed Phase 1 - Grammar and Parser implementation
  - Added method_def rule to grammar
  - Created MethodDefinition AST node
  - Implemented method_def transformer
  - Confirmed parser correctly handles method definitions with union types
- 2025-01-28: Completed Phase 2 - Method Registration
  - Created MethodRegistry class with singleton pattern
  - Integrated method registration in function executor
  - Validated receiver types and handled union type expansion
  - Confirmed methods are registered correctly in registry

## Notes & Decisions
- Chose explicit receiver syntax over implicit to follow Go philosophy
- Union types provide polymorphism without complex inheritance
- Method registry enables O(1) lookup performance
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition

## Upcoming Milestones
- Phase 1 completion: Grammar and parser support
- Phase 2 completion: Method registration system
- Phase 3 completion: Runtime execution
- Phase 4 completion: Cleanup and optimization
