LazyPromise: On-demand execution with transparent access.

This module implements lazy evaluation where computation is deferred until
first access, then cached for subsequent use. Leverages BasePromise for
comprehensive transparency.

    LazyPromise with on-demand execution and transparent access.

    Design Philosophy:
    - Creation returns immediately (never blocks)
    - No execution until first access (lazy evaluation)
    - First access triggers execution and blocks until completion
    - Subsequent access returns cached result immediately

    This lazy design is ideal for computations that may not be needed,
    allowing programs to defer expensive operations until actually required.
