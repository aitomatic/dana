# POET Use Case: Model Monitoring Agent

## The Challenge

Building production ML monitoring agents today requires:
- Manual implementation of drift detection algorithms
- Complex windowing logic that breaks with edge cases
- Feature-by-feature drift handling code
- Error-prone statistical test implementations
- Slow iteration when monitoring requirements change

## How POET Transforms This

### 1. Starting Simple: Basic Drift Detection

```python
@poet(domain="ml_monitoring")
def detect_drift(current_data, reference_data):
    """Basic drift detection between two datasets"""
    # Original: Simple comparison
    return {"drift_detected": False, "score": 0.0}
```

**POET generates v1:**
```python
def detect_drift(current_data, reference_data):
    # PERCEIVE: Validate inputs, handle edge cases
    if current_data is None or len(current_data) == 0:
        return {"drift_detected": False, "score": 0.0, "reason": "No data"}
    
    # OPERATE: KS test with proper error handling
    try:
        from scipy.stats import ks_2samp
        statistic, p_value = ks_2samp(reference_data, current_data)
        drift_detected = p_value < 0.05
        
        # ENFORCE: Ensure valid output format
        result = {
            "drift_detected": drift_detected,
            "score": statistic,
            "p_value": p_value,
            "method": "ks_test"
        }
        
        # TRAIN: Track execution
        poet_events.publish("drift.detection", {
            "execution_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "drift_detected": drift_detected,
            "data_size": len(current_data)
        })
        
        return result
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to simple comparison
        return {"drift_detected": False, "score": 0.0, "error": str(e)}
```

### 2. After Feedback: "Need KL divergence for categorical features"

**POET generates v2:**
```python
def detect_drift(current_data, reference_data):
    # PERCEIVE: Detect data type and characteristics
    data_type = _infer_data_type(current_data)
    
    # OPERATE: Choose appropriate test based on data
    if data_type == "categorical":
        # Use KL divergence for categorical
        score = _calculate_kl_divergence(current_data, reference_data)
        method = "kl_divergence"
        threshold = 0.1
    elif data_type == "continuous":
        # Use KS test for continuous
        statistic, p_value = ks_2samp(reference_data, current_data)
        score = statistic
        method = "ks_test"
        threshold = 0.05
    else:
        # Hybrid approach for mixed types
        score = _hybrid_drift_score(current_data, reference_data)
        method = "hybrid"
        threshold = 0.15
    
    drift_detected = score > threshold
    
    # ENFORCE: Rich output with interpretability
    result = {
        "drift_detected": drift_detected,
        "score": score,
        "method": method,
        "data_type": data_type,
        "threshold": threshold,
        "confidence": _calculate_confidence(len(current_data))
    }
    
    # TRAIN: Enhanced tracking
    poet_events.publish("drift.detection", {
        "execution_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "result": result,
        "performance_metrics": {
            "execution_time": execution_time,
            "data_processed": len(current_data)
        }
    })
    
    return result
```

### 3. Feature-Level Monitoring with Dynamic Windows

```python
@poet(
    domain="ml_monitoring",
    optimize_for="real_time_performance",
    config={
        "window_strategy": "adaptive",
        "feature_importance": True
    }
)
def monitor_model_features(feature_data, model_name):
    """Monitor individual features for drift with sliding windows"""
    return {"features": {}, "overall_health": "good"}
```

**POET generates sophisticated monitoring:**
```python
def monitor_model_features(feature_data, model_name):
    # PERCEIVE: Understand feature structure and importance
    feature_importance = _get_feature_importance(model_name)
    window_size = _calculate_adaptive_window(feature_data)
    
    # OPERATE: Parallel feature monitoring with sliding windows
    results = {}
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = {}
        
        for feature_name, data in feature_data.items():
            # Create sliding window
            window = SlidingWindow(
                size=window_size,
                overlap=0.5,
                adaptive=True
            )
            
            # Submit drift detection job
            future = executor.submit(
                _monitor_single_feature,
                feature_name,
                data,
                window,
                importance=feature_importance.get(feature_name, 1.0)
            )
            futures[feature_name] = future
        
        # Collect results
        for feature_name, future in futures.items():
            try:
                results[feature_name] = future.result(timeout=5.0)
            except TimeoutError:
                results[feature_name] = {
                    "status": "timeout",
                    "drift_detected": False
                }
    
    # ENFORCE: Aggregate and validate
    overall_drift_score = _weighted_drift_score(
        results, 
        feature_importance
    )
    
    overall_health = _determine_health_status(
        overall_drift_score,
        results
    )
    
    # Add recommendations
    recommendations = _generate_drift_recommendations(
        results,
        feature_importance
    )
    
    # TRAIN: Comprehensive tracking
    poet_events.publish("model.monitoring", {
        "execution_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "model_name": model_name,
        "feature_count": len(feature_data),
        "overall_health": overall_health,
        "drift_features": [f for f, r in results.items() if r.get("drift_detected")],
        "window_size": window_size
    })
    
    return {
        "features": results,
        "overall_health": overall_health,
        "overall_drift_score": overall_drift_score,
        "recommendations": recommendations,
        "window_config": {
            "size": window_size,
            "adaptive": True
        }
    }
```

### 4. Edge Case Handling Through Learning

After production issues, POET learns and regenerates:

**Feedback**: "Crashed when new feature added mid-stream"
**POET generates v3 with dynamic feature handling:**

```python
def monitor_model_features(feature_data, model_name):
    # PERCEIVE: Handle dynamic feature sets
    known_features = _get_known_features(model_name)
    new_features = set(feature_data.keys()) - known_features
    
    if new_features:
        # Auto-register new features
        for feature in new_features:
            _register_feature(model_name, feature)
            # Initialize with conservative thresholds
            _set_initial_thresholds(model_name, feature)
    
    # ... rest of monitoring logic with graceful handling
```

## The POET Advantage for ML Monitoring

### 1. **Rapid Iteration**
- Change monitoring strategy with decorator config
- No manual reimplementation of statistical tests
- LLM understands domain context

### 2. **Automatic Sophistication**
- POET adds parallelization automatically
- Implements proper error boundaries
- Adds performance tracking

### 3. **Learning from Production**
```python
# After detecting that KS test fails on sparse data
# POET automatically generates v4 with:
def _monitor_single_feature(feature_name, data, window, importance):
    # Check data density
    if _is_sparse_data(data):
        # Use different test for sparse data
        return _sparse_drift_detection(data, window)
    else:
        # Standard drift detection
        return _standard_drift_detection(data, window)
```

### 4. **Model Independence Through Templates**

```python
@poet(
    domain="ml_monitoring",
    template="model_agnostic_monitor"
)
def create_monitor(model_type, prediction_fn):
    """Creates model-independent monitor"""
    pass

# POET generates monitors that work with any model type
# by focusing on predictions, not model internals
```

## Implementation Timeline with POET

### Traditional Approach (6-8 weeks)
1. Week 1-2: Research drift detection algorithms
2. Week 3-4: Implement basic monitoring
3. Week 5-6: Add windowing, error handling
4. Week 7-8: Testing, edge case fixes

### POET Approach (1-2 weeks)
1. Day 1: Define monitoring functions with @poet
2. Day 2-3: POET generates v1 implementations
3. Day 4-5: Test and provide feedback
4. Week 2: POET refines based on feedback

## Real-World Scenario: Feature Drift Crisis

**Monday**: New feature causes monitoring crash
**Traditional**: Emergency hotfix, manual debugging (2-3 days)

**With POET**:
1. Crash event automatically captured
2. POET analyzes crash pattern
3. Generates new version handling dynamic features
4. Deployed within hours

## Code Example: Complete Monitoring Agent

```python
@poet(domain="ml_monitoring_agent")
class ModelMonitor:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.reference_data = {}
        
    @poet(optimize_for="accuracy")
    def detect_drift(self, current_data):
        """Detects drift using appropriate statistical tests"""
        pass
    
    @poet(optimize_for="real_time")
    def monitor_predictions(self, predictions, actuals):
        """Monitors prediction quality in real-time"""
        pass
    
    @poet(config={"window": "adaptive"})
    def update_reference_window(self, new_data):
        """Updates reference data with adaptive windowing"""
        pass
```

POET generates a complete, production-ready monitoring agent that:
- Handles all edge cases learned from other deployments
- Implements state-of-the-art drift detection
- Manages windows intelligently
- Scales to new features automatically

## Key Insights

1. **Domain Knowledge Built-In**: POET's ML monitoring domain template knows about KS tests, KL divergence, windowing strategies

2. **Learning Across Deployments**: When one user encounters sparse data issues, all POET instances learn to handle it

3. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with `@poet`, add sophistication through configuration and feedback

4. **No Manual Statistics**: POET implements the math correctly every time

## Conclusion

POET transforms ML monitoring from a complex engineering challenge into a configuration problem. The LLM partner understands the domain and generates sophisticated implementations that would take weeks to build manually.

The agent becomes truly scalable because:
- New monitoring requirements = new POET configuration
- Edge cases = automatic learning and regeneration  
- Feature additions = handled gracefully through regeneration
- Model independence = built into the domain template

This is the future of ML operations: intelligent code generation that learns from production and eliminates repetitive implementation work.
