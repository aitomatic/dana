## Executive Summary

POET (Perceive → Operate → Enforce → Train) is being redesigned as an LLM-powered code generation framework. Instead of complex plugin architectures, POET uses an LLM to generate enhanced Python implementations with built-in reliability, domain intelligence, and learning capabilities.

**Key Innovation**: The LLM doesn't just advise - it generates the entire enhanced function implementation with continuous learning through feedback orchestration.

## Problem Statement

Current POET implementation suffers from over-engineering:
- Complex plugin system with 15+ abstract methods
- Sophisticated learning algorithms that are rarely used  
- Heavy configuration burden preventing adoption
- Poor developer experience for simple reliability needs

**User Need**: Developers want functions that "just work better" without configuration complexity.

## Solution Overview

### Core Concept
```python
# User writes simple function
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    return llm.complete(f"Analyze: {text}")

# POET decorator triggers LLM code generation
@poet(domain="customer_service")
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    return llm.complete(f"Analyze: {text}")

# Behind scenes: LLM generates enhanced version with
# - Input validation and preprocessing (Perceive)
# - Retry logic and error handling (Operate)
# - Output validation and checks (Enforce)  
# - Feedback collection hooks (Train)
```

### Progressive User Experience
1. **Level 1**: `@poet()` - Instant reliability (retries, timeouts)
2. **Level 2**: `@poet(domain="api")` - Domain intelligence  
3. **Level 3**: `@poet(domain="api", optimize_for="speed")` - Specific goals

## Technical Design

### Architecture Components

#### 1. LLM Code Generator
The core innovation of POET is using an LLM to generate entire enhanced function implementations rather than just providing advice or configuration. This eliminates the need for complex plugin architectures and allows domain intelligence to be expressed as simple prompt templates.

```python
class POETCodeGenerator:
    def __init__(self, llm_client):
        self.llm = llm_client
        self.domain_templates = DomainTemplates()
    
    def enhance_function(self, original_func, config):
        # Generate enhanced implementation via LLM
        template = self.domain_templates.get(config.domain)
        enhanced_code = self.llm.generate(template.format(
            function_name=original_func.__name__,
            original_code=inspect.getsource(original_func),
            domain_requirements=template.requirements
        ))
        return self.compile_and_validate(enhanced_code)
```

When a user applies the `@poet()` decorator, this generator analyzes the original function and uses the LLM to create a completely new implementation that includes reliability patterns, domain-specific intelligence, and learning hooks. This approach scales to any function type without requiring manual plugin development.

#### 2. Domain Templates (Not Plugins)
Instead of complex plugin architectures with abstract base classes and multiple inheritance, POET uses simple text templates to encode domain knowledge. This approach is far easier to maintain and allows domain experts to contribute without understanding complex plugin interfaces.

```python
CUSTOMER_SERVICE_TEMPLATE = """
Generate enhanced Python implementation for {function_name}.
Domain: Customer Service

Requirements:
- Perceive: Detect emotional tone, urgency indicators
- Operate: Handle rate limits, appropriate timeouts for upset customers
- Enforce: Ensure professional tone, policy compliance
- Train: Track satisfaction signals

Original function:
{original_code}

Generate complete enhanced function with customer service intelligence.
"""
```

Each domain template encodes best practices, common patterns, and specific requirements for that domain. Adding a new domain requires only writing a new template, not implementing complex plugin interfaces. The LLM understands these natural language requirements and generates appropriate code patterns.

#### 3. Simple File Storage
POET stores all enhanced versions and metadata in a flat file structure next to the source code. This approach prioritizes simplicity and discoverability over sophisticated version management systems.

```
project/
├── my_module.py
└── .poet/
    ├── analyze_sentiment_v1.py
    ├── analyze_sentiment_v2.py
    ├── analyze_sentiment_current.py -> analyze_sentiment_v2.py
    └── analyze_sentiment_params.json
```

The `.poet/` directory keeps all POET artifacts together and makes them easy to find, inspect, and version control. The flat naming scheme (function_name_version.py) avoids complex directory hierarchies while supporting multiple versions and symlinked current versions. This storage moves with the source code and requires no database setup.

#### 4. Feedback-Driven Regeneration
The learning aspect of POET is implemented through feedback-driven code regeneration. Rather than adjusting parameters or weights, POET regenerates entire function implementations based on accumulated feedback and performance data.

```python
class FeedbackProcessor:
    def should_regenerate(self, function_name):
        params = self.load_params(function_name)
        return params.get("success_rate", 1.0) < 0.8
    
    def regenerate_with_feedback(self, function_name, feedback):
        improvement_prompt = f"""
        Improve {function_name} based on production feedback:
        - Success rate: {feedback.success_rate}
        - Common failures: {feedback.failure_patterns}
        - User feedback: {feedback.complaints}
        
        Generate improved implementation.
        """
        return self.generator.generate(improvement_prompt)
```

This approach allows POET to incorporate learnings that would be impossible with traditional parameter tuning - such as completely changing algorithmic approaches, adding new error handling patterns, or restructuring code organization. The LLM can understand complex feedback and generate appropriate improvements.

#### 5. Persistent Event Queue
POET's learning loop requires connecting execution events (function calls) with delayed feedback (user responses, performance metrics) across different program runs. Rather than requiring external message queues like Redis or RabbitMQ, POET includes a persistent file-based event system that requires zero configuration.

Located at `opendxa/common/event_queue.py`

```python
class POETEventQueue:
    """Persistent zero-admin event processing for POET learning loop"""
    def __init__(self, storage_path=".poet/events"):
        self.storage_path = Path(storage_path)
        self.storage_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        
        # In-memory queue for current session performance
        self.memory_queue = EmbeddedEventQueue()
        
        # File-based persistence for cross-session reliability
        self.pending_dir = self.storage_path / "pending"
        self.processed_dir = self.storage_path / "processed"
        self.pending_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        self.processed_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        
        # Process any events from previous runs
        self._process_pending_events()
    
    def publish(self, event_type: str, payload: dict):
        """Publish event with persistent storage"""
        event = {
            "type": event_type,
            "payload": payload,
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "status": "pending"
        }
        
        # Persist immediately (crash-safe)
        event_file = self.pending_dir / f"{event['id']}.json"
        with open(event_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(event, f)
        
        # Also process in-memory if handlers exist
        self.memory_queue.publish(event_type, payload)
    
    def subscribe(self, event_type: str, handler: callable):
        """Subscribe handler to event type"""
        self.memory_queue.subscribe(event_type, handler)
    
    def _process_pending_events(self):
        """Process events that survived from previous runs"""
        for event_file in self.pending_dir.glob("*.json"):
            try:
                with open(event_file, 'r') as f:
                    event = json.load(f)
                
                # Republish to current session handlers
                self.memory_queue.publish(event["type"], event)
                
            except Exception as e:
                logger.warning(f"Failed to process pending event {event_file}: {e}")
    
    def mark_processed(self, event_id: str):
        """Move event from pending to processed"""
        pending_file = self.pending_dir / f"{event_id}.json"
        processed_file = self.processed_dir / f"{event_id}.json"
        
        if pending_file.exists():
            pending_file.rename(processed_file)

# Global instance - zero configuration required
poet_events = POETEventQueue()
```

**Storage Structure:**
```
.poet/
├── analyze_sentiment_v1.py
├── analyze_sentiment_current.py -> analyze_sentiment_v1.py  
├── analyze_sentiment_params.json
└── events/
    ├── pending/

    └── processed/
        └── exec_xyz789.json      # Completed events (debugging)
```

**Event-Driven POET Loop:**
```python
# POET Events
EXECUTION_COMPLETED = "poet.execution.completed"
FEEDBACK_RECEIVED = "poet.feedback.received" 
REGENERATION_REQUIRED = "poet.regeneration.required"

# Generated functions publish events
def fetch_user_data_poet_enhanced(user_id):
    execution_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    try:
        result = original_logic()
        
        # Publish completion event
        poet_events.publish(EXECUTION_COMPLETED, {
            "execution_id": execution_id,
            "function_name": "fetch_user_data",
            "success": True,
            "duration": execution_time
        })
        
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        poet_events.publish(EXECUTION_COMPLETED, {
            "execution_id": execution_id,
            "success": False,
            "error": str(e)
        })
        raise

# Services subscribe to events
class FeedbackAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        poet_events.subscribe(FEEDBACK_RECEIVED, self.analyze_feedback)
    
    def analyze_feedback(self, event):
        # Process feedback and trigger regeneration if needed
        if self.should_regenerate(event["payload"]):
            poet_events.publish(REGENERATION_REQUIRED, {
                "function_name": event["payload"]["function_name"],
                "reason": "poor_performance"
            })
```

**Benefits:**
- **Zero Admin**: No external services, configuration, or setup required
- **Cross-Session Persistent**: Events survive program restarts and crashes
- **Human Readable**: JSON files can be inspected and debugged easily
- **Crash Safe**: Each event stored immediately in separate file
- **Progressive**: Can upgrade to SQLite or external queues for scale

**Progressive Upgrade Path:**
```python
# Phase 1: File-based (default, zero config)
poet_events = POETEventQueue()

# Phase 2: SQLite option (future, for complex querying)
poet_events = POETEventQueue(storage_type="sqlite")

# Phase 3: External queue (future, for enterprise scale)  
poet_events = POETEventQueue(storage_type="redis://localhost:6379")
```

This persistent approach ensures that POET's learning loop works across conversational sessions and different program runs. The temporal disconnect between function execution and delayed feedback is handled transparently through file-based event persistence, allowing learning to accumulate over time without requiring external infrastructure.

## Feedback Orchestration System

The learning capability of POET depends on sophisticated feedback collection and orchestration that connects real-world outcomes back to specific function executions. This section details how feedback events are actually generated, captured, and processed to drive continuous improvement.

### Feedback Event Types & Sources

#### 1. Drift Detection Accuracy Feedback

**Real-World Trigger Flow:**
```
Day 1, 10:00 AM → POET-enhanced function detects drift
Day 1, 10:01 AM → Alert sent to ML engineer Sarah  
Day 1, 11:30 AM → Sarah investigates, finds seasonal pattern
Day 1, 11:35 AM → Sarah marks as false positive
```

**Capture Mechanisms:**

**Option A: Explicit Feedback UI Integration**
```python
# POET automatically adds feedback tracking to generated code
def detect_drift_enhanced(current_data, reference_data):
    result = perform_drift_detection(current_data, reference_data)
    
    # POET adds this automatically
    if result["drift_detected"]:
        feedback_url = poet_feedback.create_review_link(
            execution_id=result["execution_id"],
            alert_data=result,
            callback_endpoint="/poet/feedback"
        )
        
        # Add to alert message
        result["feedback_url"] = feedback_url
        result["needs_validation"] = True
    
    return result

# When Sarah clicks "False Positive" in alert dashboard:
POST /poet/feedback
{
    "execution_id": "uuid-123",
    "feedback_type": "drift_validation", 
    "was_real_drift": false,
    "reason": "seasonal_pattern",
    "business_context": "christmas_shopping_spike"
}
```

**Option B: MLOps Platform Integration**
```python
class POETMLflowIntegration:
    def on_experiment_tagged(self, run_id, tags):
        if "drift_alert_false_positive" in tags:
            # Trace back to POET execution
            poet_execution = self.find_poet_execution(run_id)
            
            poet_events.emit("drift.validation", {
                "execution_id": poet_execution.id,
                "was_real_drift": False,
                "validation_source": "mlflow_tags",
                "human_feedback": tags.get("reason", "unspecified")
            })
```

**Option C: Implicit Action Tracking**
```python
# POET instruments generated code to watch downstream actions
@poet_action_tracker.watches("model_retrain")
def retrain_model(model_id, reason):
    new_model = train_model(model_id)
    
    # POET automatically correlates
    if reason.startswith("drift_alert_"):
        execution_id = extract_execution_id(reason)
        
        # Measure if retraining helped
        old_performance = get_model_performance(model_id, "before_retrain")
        new_performance = evaluate_model(new_model)
        
        poet_events.emit("drift.validation", {
            "execution_id": execution_id,
            "was_real_drift": new_performance > old_performance,
            "validation_source": "retraining_outcome",
            "performance_delta": new_performance - old_performance
        })
```

#### 2. Configuration Impact Feedback

**Real-World Scenario:**
```
Daily standup: "Too many drift alerts, they're noisy"
Engineer adjusts window size from 1000 to 5000 points
Noise reduces, but misses real drift 2 days later
```

**Configuration Change Detection:**
```python
class POETConfigTracker:
    def on_config_change(self, function_name, old_config, new_config):
        change_event = {
            "function": function_name,
            "parameter": "window_size", 
            "old_value": old_config.get("window_size", 1000),
            "new_value": new_config.get("window_size", 1000),
            "change_timestamp": time.now(),
            "change_reason": "manual_adjustment"
        }
        
        poet_events.emit("config.changed", change_event)
        
        # Watch for 7 days to measure impact
        self.schedule_impact_measurement(function_name, change_event, days=7)

def measure_config_impact(function_name, change_event):
    before_metrics = get_metrics(
        function_name, 
        start=change_event["timestamp"] - timedelta(days=7),
        end=change_event["timestamp"]
    )
    
    after_metrics = get_metrics(
        function_name,
        start=change_event["timestamp"], 
        end=change_event["timestamp"] + timedelta(days=7)
    )
    
    poet_events.emit("window_size.impact_measured", {
        "config_change": change_event,
        "false_positive_rate_before": before_metrics["false_positives"] / before_metrics["total_alerts"],
        "false_positive_rate_after": after_metrics["false_positives"] / after_metrics["total_alerts"],
        "detection_latency_before": before_metrics["avg_detection_delay"],
        "detection_latency_after": after_metrics["avg_detection_delay"]
    })
```

#### 3. Alert System Integration

**PagerDuty/Slack Integration:**
```python
class POETAlertSystemIntegration:
    def on_alert_created(self, alert_data):
        incident = self.pagerduty_client.create_incident({
            "title": f"Model Drift: {alert_data['feature']}",
            "custom_details": {
                "poet_execution_id": alert_data["execution_id"],
                "poet_function": alert_data["function_name"]
            }
        })
        
        poet_events.emit("alert.created", {
            "execution_id": alert_data["execution_id"],
            "alert_id": incident["id"],
            "created_at": time.now()
        })
    
    def on_incident_acknowledged(self, incident_id, user_id, ack_time):
        poet_execution = self.find_poet_execution_by_alert(incident_id)
        
        poet_events.emit("alert.acknowledged", {
            "execution_id": poet_execution["execution_id"],
            "time_to_ack": ack_time - poet_execution["created_at"],
            "acknowledged_by": user_id
        })

# Batch dismissal detection
def on_batch_alert_dismissal(alert_ids, dismissal_reason):
    poet_executions = [find_poet_execution_by_alert(aid) for aid in alert_ids]
    
    common_patterns = find_common_patterns(poet_executions)
    
    poet_events.emit("alert.batch_dismissed", {
        "execution_ids": [pe["execution_id"] for pe in poet_executions],
        "dismissal_reason": dismissal_reason,
        "common_patterns": common_patterns,
        "alert_count": len(alert_ids)
    })
```

#### 4. Cost & Business Impact Tracking

**Cloud Cost Attribution:**
```python
class POETCostTracker:
    def track_execution_cost(self, execution_id, function_name):
        # Tag resources with POET execution ID
        self.tag_resources_for_execution(execution_id, {
            "poet:execution_id": execution_id,
            "poet:function": function_name,
            "poet:timestamp": str(time.now())
        })
    
    def daily_cost_attribution(self):
        costs = self.aws_client.get_cost_and_usage(
            TimePeriod={'Start': '2024-01-01', 'End': '2024-01-02'},
            GroupBy=[{'Type': 'TAG', 'Key': 'poet:execution_id'}]
        )
        
        for cost_group in costs['ResultsByTime'][0]['Groups']:
            execution_id = cost_group['Keys'][0]
            cost = float(cost_group['Metrics']['BlendedCost']['Amount'])
            
            poet_events.emit("execution.cost_measured", {
                "execution_id": execution_id,
                "cost_usd": cost,
                "measurement_date": "2024-01-01"
            })
```

**Business Impact Correlation:**
```python
class POETBusinessImpactTracker:
    def correlate_drift_with_business_metrics(self):
        drift_events = poet_events.query("drift.detected", days=30)
        
        for event in drift_events:
            business_impact = self.measure_business_impact(
                model_name=event["model_name"],
                drift_time=event["timestamp"],
                window_hours=24
            )
            
            poet_events.emit("drift.business_impact_measured", {
                "execution_id": event["execution_id"],
                "revenue_impact": business_impact["revenue_change"],
                "conversion_impact": business_impact["conversion_change"]
            })
```

### Learning Loop Orchestration

**Central Learning Engine:**
```python
class POETLearningOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feedback_aggregator = FeedbackAggregator()
        self.pattern_analyzer = PatternAnalyzer()
        self.code_regenerator = CodeRegenerator()
        
    def process_feedback_batch(self):
        """Runs every hour to process accumulated feedback"""
        
        # 1. Aggregate feedback by function
        feedback_by_function = self.feedback_aggregator.group_by_function()
        
        for function_name, feedback_events in feedback_by_function.items():
            # 2. Analyze patterns
            patterns = self.pattern_analyzer.find_patterns(feedback_events)
            
            # 3. Decide if regeneration is needed
            if self.should_regenerate(patterns):
                # 4. Generate improved version
                self.regenerate_function(function_name, patterns)

        """Decide if we have enough signal to improve"""
        return (
            patterns["false_positive_rate"] > 0.3 or  # Too many false positives
            patterns["missed_drift_rate"] > 0.1 or   # Missing real drifts
            patterns["alert_fatigue_score"] > 0.7 or # Users ignoring alerts
            patterns["cost_efficiency"] < 0.5        # Poor cost/benefit
        )
    
    def regenerate_function(self, function_name, patterns):
        """Generate improved version based on learned patterns"""
        
        current_impl = self.get_current_implementation(function_name)
        
        improvement_prompt = f"""
        The current implementation has these issues based on production feedback:
        - False positive rate: {patterns['false_positive_rate']}
        - Common false positive causes: {patterns['false_positive_reasons']}
        - Performance issues: {patterns['performance_issues']}

        {current_impl}
        """
        
        new_impl = self.code_regenerator.generate(improvement_prompt)
        self.deploy_new_version(function_name, new_impl, patterns)
```

### DANA Integration for ML Monitoring

The feedback orchestration system is designed to work seamlessly with DANA code, allowing users to write simple monitoring logic while POET handles the complex learning infrastructure.

**DANA Code with Feedback Hooks:**
```dana
@poet(domain="ml_monitoring", learning="continuous")
agent ModelMonitor:
    state:
        feedback_buffer: list[FeedbackEvent]
        learning_threshold: int = 10
    
    @poet(capability="drift_detection")
    def detect_drift(self, current_data, reference_data):
        # Simple DANA logic that POET enhances
        return basic_drift_check(current_data, reference_data)
    
    def collect_feedback(self, event: FeedbackEvent):
        """POET uses this to accumulate learning signals"""
        self.feedback_buffer.append(event)
        
        if len(self.feedback_buffer) >= self.learning_threshold:
            # Trigger POET learning
            poet_learn_from_feedback(self.feedback_buffer)
            self.feedback_buffer = []
    
    pipeline monitoring_with_feedback:
        input: model_data
        
        # Monitor with POET enhancement
        result = self.detect_drift(model_data.current, model_data.reference)
        
        # Track result for feedback correlation
        tracking_id = track_execution(result)
        
        # Async feedback collection
        on_feedback_received(tracking_id) -> feedback:
            self.collect_feedback(feedback)
        
        output: result
```

### Key Orchestration Benefits

1. **Multi-Source Integration**: Feedback from alert systems, cost tracking, business metrics, user actions
2. **Automatic Correlation**: Connects actions (retraining, dismissals) back to original executions  
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Learning happens at pattern level, not individual events
4. **Gradual Improvement**: Each version incorporates lessons from production
5. **Transparent to Users**: Complex orchestration behind simple DANA decorators

**User Experience:**
- **User writes**: Simple DANA monitoring functions with `@poet` decorators
- **POET orchestrates**: Complex learning system with feedback collection
- **Result**: Continuously improving monitoring that learns from production reality

This feedback orchestration system transforms POET from a static enhancement tool into a dynamic learning partner that evolves with real-world usage patterns and requirements.

## Use Case: Prompt Optimization

POET is particularly powerful for evolving and optimizing LLM prompts based on measurable objectives and real-world performance. This use case demonstrates how POET learns to improve prompts over time.

### Objective Definition

#### Simple String Objectives
```python
@poet(
    domain="prompt_optimization",
    optimize_for="accuracy"  # Simple objective
)
def analyze_document(text):
    return llm.complete(f"Analyze: {text}")
```

#### Multi-Objective Optimization  
```python
@poet(
    domain="prompt_optimization",
    objectives={
        "accuracy": {"weight": 0.6, "target": 0.90},
        "speed": {"weight": 0.3, "minimize": True, "target": 3.0},
        "cost": {"weight": 0.1, "minimize": True, "budget": 0.25}
    }
)
def summarize_article(article):
    return llm.complete(f"Summarize: {article}")
```

#### Constraint-Based Objectives
```python
@poet(
    domain="prompt_optimization",
    optimize_for="helpfulness",
    constraints={
        "max_tokens": 500,
        "response_time": 5.0,
        "cost_per_call": 0.10
    }
)
def customer_support(query):
    return llm.complete(f"Help: {query}")
```

### Measurement Strategies

**Automatic Metrics** (Built-in to POET):
- Response time and token usage
- API costs and rate limit tracking
- Response length and format compliance
- Confidence indicators in output

**LLM-Based Evaluation**:
```python
# POET automatically evaluates responses
def evaluate_response(prompt, response, objective):
    eval_prompt = f"""
    Evaluate this response for {objective}:
    User Query: {prompt}
    LLM Response: {response}
    
    Rate 0.0-1.0 for:
    - Accuracy: Are facts correct?
    - Relevance: Does it address the query?
    - Helpfulness: Can user act on this?
    
    Return JSON scores.
    """
    return evaluator_llm.complete(eval_prompt)
```

**User Feedback Signals**:
- Explicit ratings and surveys
- Implicit signals from follow-up questions
- Task completion tracking
- User engagement metrics

### Learning-Driven Prompt Evolution

#### Example: Sentiment Analysis Optimization

**Initial Function:**
```python
@poet(
    domain="prompt_optimization",
    optimize_for="accuracy",
    constraints={"max_tokens": 200}
)
def analyze_sentiment(review_text):
    return llm.complete(f"Analyze sentiment: {review_text}")
```

**POET Generates v1 (Basic Enhancement):**
```python
def analyze_sentiment_poet_enhanced_v1(review_text):
    # More specific prompt for accuracy
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the sentiment of this review:
    
    Review: "{review_text}"
    
    Provide:
    1. Overall sentiment: positive/negative/neutral
    2. Confidence score (0-100%)
    3. Key phrases indicating sentiment
    
    Format as JSON.
    """
    
    response = llm.complete(prompt, max_tokens=200)
    
    # Track execution for learning
    poet_events.publish("execution.completed", {
        "execution_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "function_name": "analyze_sentiment",
        "prompt_version": "v1_specific",
        "accuracy_score": None  # Filled by feedback
    })
    
    return response
```

**After Learning (Low Accuracy Feedback):**

Learning Analysis detects:
- Accuracy: 0.72 (target: 0.90)
- Common errors: Missing sarcasm, confused by mixed sentiments
- User feedback: "Often wrong on nuanced reviews"

**POET Generates v2 (Learned Improvements):**
```python
def analyze_sentiment_poet_enhanced_v2(review_text):
    # Evolved prompt based on failure analysis
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert sentiment analyst. Carefully analyze this review:
    
    Review: "{review_text}"
    
    Consider:
    - Sarcasm and irony (look for contradictions)
    - Mixed sentiments (both positive AND negative)
    - Context clues and implicit meanings
    
    Provide:
    1. Primary sentiment: positive/negative/neutral/mixed
    2. If mixed, secondary sentiment
    3. Confidence: 0-100%
    4. Reasoning: WHY you chose this (key phrases)
    5. Sarcasm detected: yes/no
    
    JSON format required. Be precise.
    """
    
    response = llm.complete(prompt, max_tokens=200)
    
    poet_events.publish("execution.completed", {
        "execution_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "function_name": "analyze_sentiment",
        "prompt_version": "v2_nuanced",
        "improvements": ["sarcasm_detection", "mixed_sentiment", "reasoning"]
    })
    
    return response
```

### Objective-Driven Learning Loop

```python
class PromptOptimizationAnalyzer:
    def analyze_performance(self, function_name, objective):
        """Determine if prompt needs improvement based on objective"""
        
        metrics = self.aggregate_metrics(function_name)
        
        if objective == "accuracy":
            if metrics.accuracy < 0.80:
                return {
                    "needs_regeneration": True,
                    "reason": f"Accuracy {metrics.accuracy} below target 0.80",
                    "improvement_focus": [
                        "Add more specific instructions",
                        "Request reasoning/explanation",
                        "Handle edge cases explicitly"
                    ]
                }
                
        elif objective == "efficiency":
            if metrics.avg_tokens > metrics.token_budget * 1.2:
                return {
                    "needs_regeneration": True,
                    "reason": f"Using {metrics.avg_tokens} tokens vs {metrics.token_budget} budget",
                    "improvement_focus": [
                        "Shorter, more concise prompts",
                        "Remove redundant instructions",
                        "Use compressed formats"
                    ]
                }
```

### End-to-End Prompt Optimization Flow

1. **User defines objective**: `@poet(optimize_for="accuracy")`
2. **POET generates initial enhanced prompt** with measurement hooks
3. **Function executes**, tracking performance metrics
4. **Feedback collected** from users and automatic evaluation
5. **Learning analysis** identifies prompt weaknesses
6. **LLM regenerates prompt** addressing specific issues
7. **New version deployed** automatically
8. **Performance improves** measurably
9. **Cycle continues** with continuous optimization

### Common Prompt Optimization Patterns

**For Accuracy:**
- Add specific criteria and definitions
- Request step-by-step reasoning
- Include few-shot examples
- Handle edge cases explicitly

**For Efficiency:**
- Compress instructions to essential elements
- Use structured output formats
- Remove redundant context
- Optimize token usage

**For Helpfulness:**
- Request actionable recommendations
- Include confidence indicators
- Provide multiple alternatives
- Explain reasoning clearly

This use case shows how POET transforms simple prompt-based functions into continuously learning systems that improve based on real performance data and user feedback.

### Generated Code Example

**Original Function:**
```python
@poet(domain="api", optimize_for="reliability")
def fetch_user_data(user_id):
    return requests.get(f"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}").json()
```

**LLM-Generated Enhancement:**
```python
def fetch_user_data_poet_enhanced(user_id):
    # P: Perceive - Input validation
    if not user_id or not isinstance(user_id, (str, int)):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid user_id: {user_id}")
    
    # O: Operate - Enhanced execution  
    import requests
    from time import sleep
    
    endpoints = [
        f"https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}",
        f"https://backup-api.example.com/users/{user_id}"
    ]
    
    for endpoint in endpoints:
        for attempt in range(3):
            try:
                response = requests.get(endpoint, timeout=10)
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    result = response.json()
                    break
                elif response.status_code == 429:
                    sleep(2 ** attempt)
                    continue
            except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
                if attempt < 2:
                    sleep(1)
                    continue
                
    # E: Enforce - Output validation
    required_fields = ["id", "name", "email"]
    if not all(field in result for field in required_fields):
        raise ValueError(f"Incomplete user data: missing {required_fields}")
    
    # T: Train - Feedback hooks
    poet_track_execution(
        function="fetch_user_data",
        success=True,
        attempts=attempt + 1,
        endpoint=endpoint
    )
    
    return result
```

- **Direct enhancement**: LLM generates code, not metadata
- **Function-focused**: One enhancement per function

### YAGNI Principles Applied  
- **No frameworks**: Domain templates, not plugin architectures
- **No premature optimization**: Basic reliability first
- **No speculative features**: Build for actual user needs
- **No complex abstractions**: Direct code generation

This design prioritizes developer experience and practical utility over architectural sophistication, making POET genuinely useful for everyday coding tasks.
