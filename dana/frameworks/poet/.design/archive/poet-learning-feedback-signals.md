# POET Learning Loops & Feedback Signals for ML Monitoring

## Learning Categories & Required Feedback Signals

### 1. **Drift Detection Accuracy Learning**

**What to Learn:**
- Which statistical test works best for specific data distributions
- Optimal thresholds for different feature types
- When to use ensemble methods vs single tests

**Feedback Signals Needed:**
```dana
// Explicit feedback after investigation
dana_events.emit("drift.validation", {
    "execution_id": "uuid-123",
    "feature": "user_age",
    "was_real_drift": true,  // Human validated
    "business_impact": "high",  // Critical feedback
    "root_cause": "demographic_shift"  // Context
})

// Implicit feedback from downstream actions
dana_events.emit("model.retrained", {
    "trigger": "drift_alert_uuid-123",
    "performance_before": 0.82,
    "performance_after": 0.91,  // Drift was real, retraining helped
    "retraining_cost": "$1200"
})

// False positive feedback
dana_events.emit("drift.false_positive", {
    "execution_id": "uuid-456", 
    "reason": "seasonal_pattern",  // Not drift, just Christmas shopping
    "wasted_investigation_time": "2_hours"
})
```

**POET Learning Response:**
```python
# POET analyzes: KS test has 40% false positive rate on seasonal data
# Regenerates v2 with seasonal decomposition:
def detect_drift(current_data, reference_data):
    # New: Check for seasonality first
    if has_seasonal_pattern(current_data):
        # Use seasonal-adjusted drift detection
        deseasonalized = remove_seasonality(current_data)
        return seasonal_drift_test(deseasonalized, reference_data)
    else:
        # Original KS test for non-seasonal
        return ks_test(current_data, reference_data)
```

### 2. **Window Size Optimization Learning**

**What to Learn:**
- Optimal window sizes for different data velocities
- When to expand/shrink windows
- Balance between responsiveness and stability

**Feedback Signals Needed:**
```dana
// Drift detection latency feedback
dana_events.emit("drift.detection_delay", {
    "actual_drift_start": "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
    "detected_at": "2024-01-15T14:00:00",
    "delay_hours": 4,
    "window_size_used": 10000,
    "data_velocity": 1000  // points per hour
})

// Noise/stability feedback
dana_events.emit("drift.noise_issue", {
    "false_alarms_per_day": 15,
    "window_size": 100,  // Too small, too noisy
    "feature": "click_rate"
})

// Resource consumption feedback
dana_events.emit("monitoring.performance", {
    "window_size": 50000,
    "memory_usage_mb": 2048,
    "computation_time_ms": 5000,
    "timeout_occurred": true
})
```

**POET Learning Response:**
```python
# POET learns: High-velocity features need smaller, adaptive windows
def calculate_adaptive_window(feature_name, data_velocity, stability_requirement):
    # Learned patterns:
    if data_velocity > 5000:  # High velocity
        base_window = 500  # Smaller for responsiveness
        
        # But adjust based on feature stability
        if feature_name in ["revenue", "conversions"]:  # Critical, need stability
            return base_window * 2
    else:
        # Low velocity can use larger windows
        base_window = 5000
    
    # Learned: Memory constraints at 50K points
    return min(base_window, 45000)
```

### 3. **Feature Importance Learning**

**What to Learn:**
- Which features actually matter for model performance
- Dynamic importance based on context
- Correlation between feature drift and model degradation

**Feedback Signals Needed:**
```dana
// Model performance correlation
dana_events.emit("feature.drift_impact", {
    "feature": "user_location",
    "drift_score": 0.8,
    "model_performance_drop": 0.02,  // Minimal impact despite high drift
    "business_metric_impact": "none"
})

// Business outcome feedback
dana_events.emit("business.metric_degradation", {
    "metric": "conversion_rate",
    "drop_percent": 15,
    "correlated_drifted_features": ["ad_spend", "user_segment"],
    "uncorrelated_drifted_features": ["browser_type", "device_id"]
})

// Feature interaction feedback
dana_events.emit("feature.interaction_discovered", {
    "primary_feature": "price",
    "interacting_feature": "day_of_week",
    "combined_impact": "high",  // Together they matter
    "individual_impact": "low"   // Separately they don't
})
```

**POET Learning Response:**
```python
# POET learns feature importance is context-dependent
def calculate_feature_importance(feature_name, context):
    # Learned: Static importance isn't enough
    base_importance = get_static_importance(feature_name)
    
    # Learned patterns from feedback
    if context.time_of_year == "black_friday":
        if feature_name in ["price", "discount"]:
            return base_importance * 3  # Much more important
    
    # Learned interactions
    if feature_name == "price" and "day_of_week" in context.other_features:
        return base_importance * 1.5
    
    # Learned: Some features never matter
    if feature_name in learned_irrelevant_features:
        return 0.1  # Monitor but don't alert
    
    return base_importance
```

```dana
// Alert response tracking
dana_events.emit("alert.response", {
    "alert_id": "drift-789",
    "time_to_acknowledge": 3600,  // 1 hour - too long
    "action_taken": "ignored",
    "reason": "too_many_similar_alerts"
})

// Alert usefulness feedback
dana_events.emit("alert.usefulness", {
    "alert_batch": ["drift-1", "drift-2", "drift-3"],
    "investigated": ["drift-1"],  // Only looked at first one
    "useful": false,
    "feedback": "all_same_root_cause"
})

// Threshold adjustment feedback
dana_events.emit("threshold.adjustment", {
    "feature": "latency",
    "old_threshold": 0.05,
    "manually_adjusted_to": 0.15,
    "reason": "too_sensitive_for_this_feature"
})
```

**POET Learning Response:**
```python
# POET learns to reduce alert fatigue
def generate_alerts(drift_results):
    # Learned: Group correlated drifts
    alert_groups = cluster_related_drifts(drift_results)
    
    # Learned: Suppress based on patterns
    for group in alert_groups:
        if matches_known_false_pattern(group):
            continue  # Don't alert
        
        # Learned: Smart batching
        if len(group) > 3:
            # Single summary alert instead of many
            create_summary_alert(group)
        else:
            create_individual_alerts(group)
    
    # Learned: Time-based suppression
    if similar_alert_sent_recently():
        increase_threshold_temporarily()
```

### 5. **Error Recovery Learning**

**What to Learn:**
- Common failure modes and recovery strategies
- Timeout patterns
- Data quality issues

**Feedback Signals Needed:**
```dana
// Error pattern tracking
dana_events.emit("error.occurred", {
    "error_type": "timeout",
    "context": {
        "data_size": 100000,
        "feature_count": 500,
        "computation": "kl_divergence"
    },

```

**POET Learning Response:**
```python

def monitor_with_recovery(data):
    # Learned: Pre-check data quality
    quality_check = assess_data_quality(data)
    
    if quality_check.sparsity > 0.9:
        # Learned: Use different algorithm for sparse data
        return sparse_data_monitoring(data)
    
    try:
        # Learned: Set dynamic timeouts
        timeout = calculate_timeout(len(data), quality_check.complexity)
        
        with timeout_context(timeout):
            return full_monitoring(data)
            
    except TimeoutError:
        # Learned: Smart degradation
        if data.size > 50000:
            # Sample for large data
            sampled = adaptive_sample(data, target_size=10000)
            return monitoring_with_sampling_flag(sampled)
        else:
            # Use faster approximate method
            return approximate_monitoring(data)
```

### 6. **Cost-Benefit Learning**

**What to Learn:**
- Balance between monitoring thoroughness and resource cost
- ROI of different monitoring strategies
- When detailed monitoring is worth it

**Feedback Signals Needed:**
```dana
// Cost tracking
dana_events.emit("monitoring.cost", {
    "execution_id": "run-456",
    "compute_cost": 0.50,  // $0.50 per run
    "features_monitored": 100,
    "drift_detected": false,
    "business_value": 0  // No value since no drift
})

// Value tracking
dana_events.emit("monitoring.value_delivered", {
    "drift_catch": "drift-789",
    "prevented_loss": 50000,  // $50K saved by early detection
    "monitoring_cost": 100,   // $100 spent on monitoring
    "roi": 500
})

// Resource optimization feedback
dana_events.emit("resource.optimization_needed", {
    "monthly_cost": 5000,
    "drifts_caught": 2,
    "false_positives": 48,

})
```

**POET Learning Response:**
```python

def adaptive_monitoring_strategy(model_context):
    # Learned: Business-critical models need thorough monitoring
    if model_context.business_impact == "critical":
        return {
            "frequency": "real_time",
            "all_features": True,
            "multiple_tests": True
        }
    
    # Learned: Low-impact models can use lighter monitoring
    if model_context.historical_drift_rate < 0.01:
        return {
            "frequency": "daily",
            "all_features": False,  # Top 10 only
            "multiple_tests": False  # Single test sufficient
        }
    
    # Learned: Dynamic strategy based on recent patterns
    if model_context.recent_incidents > 0:
        # Temporarily increase monitoring
        return enhance_monitoring_temporarily()
```

## Integration Pattern for Feedback Collection

```dana
@poet(domain="ml_monitoring", learning="continuous")
agent SmartMonitor:
    state:
        feedback_buffer: list[FeedbackEvent]
        learning_threshold: int = 10
    
    def collect_feedback(self, event: FeedbackEvent):
        """POET uses this to learn"""
        self.feedback_buffer.append(event)
        
        if len(self.feedback_buffer) >= self.learning_threshold:
            # Trigger POET learning
            poet_learn_from_feedback(self.feedback_buffer)
            self.feedback_buffer = []
    
    pipeline monitoring_with_feedback:
        input: model_data
        
        # Monitor
        result = self.detect_drift(model_data)
        
        # Track result for feedback
        tracking_id = track_execution(result)
        
        # Wait for feedback (async)
        on_feedback_received(tracking_id) -> feedback:
            self.collect_feedback(feedback)
        
        output: result
```

## Key Insights on Learning Loops

1. **Multi-Signal Learning**: POET needs various feedback types - explicit validation, implicit outcomes, performance metrics, and cost data

2. **Contextual Learning**: Feedback must include context (time, business cycle, data characteristics) for meaningful learning

3. **Continuous Adaptation**: Learning isn't one-time - POET continuously refines based on ongoing feedback

4. **Domain-Specific Patterns**: ML monitoring has unique patterns (seasonality, feature interactions, drift types) that POET learns

5. **Cost-Aware Learning**: Balancing monitoring thoroughness with resource costs based on business value

The key is making feedback collection seamless in DANA code while POET handles the complex learning and regeneration behind the scenes.
