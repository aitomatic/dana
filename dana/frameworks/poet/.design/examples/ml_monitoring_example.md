# POET ML Monitoring Examples

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive examples of how POET transforms simple monitoring functions into production-grade ML monitoring systems. These examples demonstrate the progression from basic DANA code to sophisticated Python implementations.

## Challenge: Traditional ML Monitoring

Building production ML monitoring agents today requires:
- Manual implementation of drift detection algorithms
- Complex windowing logic that breaks with edge cases
- Feature-by-feature drift handling code
- Error-prone statistical test implementations
- Slow iteration when monitoring requirements change

## POET Solution: Progressive Enhancement

### Example 1: Basic Drift Detection

**DANA Input (.na file):**
```dana
@poet(domain="ml_monitoring")
def detect_drift(current_data: list[float], reference_data: list[float]) -> dict:
    # Simple DANA implementation
    return {"drift_detected": false, "score": 0.0}
```

**POET Generated v1 (via Aitomatic Transpilation + Enhancement):**
```python
def detect_drift(current_data: list[float], reference_data: list[float]) -> dict:
    # PERCEIVE: Validate inputs, handle edge cases
    if not current_data or len(current_data) == 0:
        return {"drift_detected": False, "score": 0.0, "reason": "No data"}
    
    # OPERATE: KS test with proper error handling
    try:
        from scipy.stats import ks_2samp
        statistic, p_value = ks_2samp(reference_data, current_data)
        drift_detected = p_value < 0.05
        
        # ENFORCE: Ensure valid output format
        result = {
            "drift_detected": drift_detected,
            "score": statistic,
            "p_value": p_value,
            "method": "ks_test"
        }
        
        # TRAIN: Track execution
        poet_events.emit("drift.detection", {
            "execution_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "drift_detected": drift_detected,
            "data_size": len(current_data)
        })
        
        return result
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to simple comparison
        return {"drift_detected": False, "score": 0.0, "error": str(e)}
```

**After Feedback: "Need KL divergence for categorical features"**

**POET Generated v2 (Learning-Based Enhancement):**
```python
def detect_drift(current_data: list[float], reference_data: list[float]) -> dict:
    # PERCEIVE: Detect data type and characteristics
    data_type = _infer_data_type(current_data)
    
    # OPERATE: Choose appropriate test based on data
    if data_type == "categorical":
        # Use KL divergence for categorical
        score = _calculate_kl_divergence(current_data, reference_data)
        method = "kl_divergence"
        threshold = 0.1
    elif data_type == "continuous":
        # Use KS test for continuous
        statistic, p_value = ks_2samp(reference_data, current_data)
        score = statistic
        method = "ks_test"
        threshold = 0.05
    else:
        # Hybrid approach for mixed types
        score = _hybrid_drift_score(current_data, reference_data)
        method = "hybrid"
        threshold = 0.15
    
    drift_detected = score > threshold
    
    # ENFORCE: Rich output with interpretability
    result = {
        "drift_detected": drift_detected,
        "score": score,
        "method": method,
        "data_type": data_type,
        "threshold": threshold,
        "confidence": _calculate_confidence(len(current_data))
    }
    
    # TRAIN: Enhanced tracking
    poet_events.emit("drift.detection", {
        "execution_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "result": result,
        "performance_metrics": {
            "execution_time": execution_time,
            "data_processed": len(current_data)
        }
    })
    
    return result
```

### Example 2: Feature-Level Monitoring Agent

**DANA Input (.na file):**
```dana
@poet(
    domain="ml_monitoring",
    optimize_for="real_time_performance"
)
agent ModelMonitorAgent:
    state:
        model_name: str
        reference_windows: dict[str, list[float]]
    
    @poet(capability="drift_detection")
    def monitor_features(self, feature_data: dict[str, list[float]]) -> dict:
        """Monitor all features for drift"""
        results = {}
        
        for feature_name, data in feature_data.items():
            # Simple DANA logic
            stats = calculate_stats(data)
            results[feature_name] = stats
        
        return results
```

        )
        
        # TRAIN: Comprehensive tracking

### Example 3: Complete ML Monitoring System

**DANA Input (.na file):**
```dana
@poet(domain="ml_monitoring_production")
module MLMonitor:
    
    # Simple DANA types that POET enhances
    struct ModelHealth:
        score: float

        features_drifted: list[str]
    
    # POET makes this production-ready
    @poet(capabilities=["drift", "anomaly", "performance"])
    agent ProductionMonitor:

            trigger_retraining(model_output.model_id)
        
        output: health
```

**POET Generated System (Enterprise-Grade):**

            component_scores=health_components
        )
```

### Example 4: Edge Case Handling Through Learning

**Production Issue**: "Crashed when new feature added mid-stream"

**POET Generated v3 (Learning-Based Resilience):**
```python
def monitor_model_features(feature_data, model_name):
    # PERCEIVE: Handle dynamic feature sets
    known_features = self._get_known_features(model_name)
    new_features = set(feature_data.keys()) - known_features
    
    if new_features:
        # Auto-register new features
        for feature in new_features:
            self._register_feature(model_name, feature)
            # Initialize with conservative thresholds
            self._set_initial_thresholds(model_name, feature)
            
        # Log new feature discovery
        poet_events.emit("feature.discovery", {
            "model_name": model_name,
            "new_features": list(new_features),
            "discovery_timestamp": time.time()
        })
    
    # OPERATE: Graceful handling of mixed feature sets
    monitoring_results = {}
    
    # Process known features with full monitoring
    for feature_name in known_features.intersection(feature_data.keys()):
        monitoring_results[feature_name] = self._full_feature_monitoring(
            feature_name, feature_data[feature_name]
        )
    
    # Process new features with conservative monitoring
    for feature_name in new_features:
        monitoring_results[feature_name] = self._conservative_feature_monitoring(
            feature_name, feature_data[feature_name]
        )
    
    # ENFORCE: Ensure system stability despite schema changes
    if len(new_features) / len(feature_data) > 0.5:
        # Too many new features - enter safe mode
        return self._safe_mode_monitoring(feature_data, model_name)
    
    return monitoring_results
```

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

### 1. **Rapid Development**
- **Traditional Approach**: 6-8 weeks to implement production monitoring
- **POET Approach**: 1-2 weeks from DANA function to production system

### 2. **Automatic Sophistication**
- POET adds parallelization, error handling, statistical tests automatically
- Implements domain best practices without manual coding
- Handles edge cases learned from other deployments

### 3. **Continuous Learning**
- Functions improve based on real production feedback
- False positive rates decrease over time
- Alert fatigue reduces through intelligent pattern recognition

### 4. **Model Independence**
- Generated monitors work with any model type
- Focus on predictions and data, not model internals
- Portable across different ML frameworks

## Implementation Timeline Comparison

### Traditional Manual Implementation
1. **Week 1-2**: Research drift detection algorithms
2. **Week 3-4**: Implement basic monitoring
3. **Week 5-6**: Add windowing, error handling
4. **Week 7-8**: Testing, edge case fixes

### POET-Enhanced Implementation
1. **Day 1**: Define DANA monitoring functions with `@poet`
2. **Day 2-3**: POET generates v1 implementations via Aitomatic
3. **Day 4-5**: Test and provide feedback
4. **Week 2**: POET refines based on production feedback

## Real-World Crisis Scenario

**Traditional Response**:
- **Monday**: New feature causes monitoring crash
- **Emergency**: Manual debugging and hotfix development (2-3 days)
- **Resolution**: Specific fix that doesn't prevent similar issues

**POET Response**:
1. **Monday 10:00 AM**: Crash event automatically captured by POET
2. **Monday 11:00 AM**: POET analyzes crash pattern and regenerates robust version
3. **Monday 12:00 PM**: New version deployed with dynamic feature handling
4. **Future**: All POET instances learn to handle similar schema changes

## Conclusion

POET transforms ML monitoring from a complex engineering challenge into a configuration and learning problem. The examples demonstrate how simple DANA functions evolve into enterprise-grade monitoring systems that would traditionally require months of development.

The key insight: By combining LLM code generation with continuous learning from production feedback, POET creates monitoring systems that not only work out of the box but continuously improve based on real-world usage patterns.
