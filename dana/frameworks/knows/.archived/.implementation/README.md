# KNOWS Framework Implementation

```text
Author: Aitomatic Engineering
Version: 0.1
Date: 2024-03-19
Status: Implementation Phase
Module: opendxa.knows
```

## Implementation Order

The KNOWS framework components should be implemented in the following order, based on their dependencies and foundational requirements:

1. **Knowledge Organizations** (`knowledge_organizations.md`)
   - Foundation layer
   - Provides core data storage and retrieval
   - Required by all other components
   - Implementation: Redis, PostgreSQL, Vector Store, Time Series Store

2. **Context Management** (`context_management.md`)
   - Builds on knowledge storage
   - Manages state and context
   - Required by workflow and query systems
   - Implementation: Environmental, Agent, Workflow contexts

3. **Query Interface** (`query_interface.md`)
   - Depends on knowledge organizations
   - Uses context management
   - Required by workflow system
   - Implementation: Semantic, Structured, Time-series queries

4. **Workflow System** (`workflow_system.md`)
   - Depends on knowledge organizations
   - Uses context management
   - Uses query interface
   - Core business logic layer
   - Implementation: Templates, Execution, State Management

5. **Integration Layer** (`integration_layer.md`)
   - Depends on all other components
   - Connects to external systems
   - Uses workflow system
   - Uses query interface
   - Implementation: REST, GraphQL, Database, Message Queue

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow module structure in `opendxa/knows/`
- Use appropriate subdirectories for each component
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow Python package structure

### Implementation Standards
- Use Dana language for domain logic
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints consistently
- Document all public APIs
- Write comprehensive tests

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Error handling tests
- Security tests

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Architecture diagrams
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guides

## Getting Started

1. Review the design document in `opendxa/knows/.design/`
