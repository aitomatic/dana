## Problem Statement

Industrial, financial, and enterprise environments require agentic workflows that combine the robustness and flexibility of neural approaches with the reproducibility, explainability, and determinism demanded by regulated domains. Currently, AI engineers must choose between:

- **Neural-only approaches** that offer flexibility but lack transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance
- **Symbolic-only approaches** that provide determinism but cannot handle edge cases or incomplete specifications
- **Manual orchestration** that places unsustainable cognitive load on engineers who understand domain processes but not AI/ML internals

The critical gap is the absence of a system that enables **domain experts** (process engineers, compliance officers, subject matter experts) to encode their well-defined, regulated workflows using **natural language specifications** while the **runtime guarantees** reproducibility, provides full explainability, and maintains deterministic control over all execution paths.

**How might we enable domain experts to specify intelligent agentic workflows at the right level of abstraction—declarative enough for reliability and transparency, yet flexible enough for adaptive processing—while the runtime provides context injection, fault tolerance, output validation, and adaptive learning?**

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Domain Expert Workflow Specification**
   - Enable subject matter experts to specify workflows using natural language descriptions of their business processes
   - No requirement for AI/ML knowledge, prompting expertise, or technical implementation details
   - Support for regulatory requirements, compliance checks, and domain-specific constraints

2. **Neural Flexibility with Symbolic Guarantees**
   - Leverage LLM robustness for handling edge cases, incomplete specifications, and creative problem-solving
   - Provide deterministic guarantees through symbolic validation at every workflow step
   - Ensure every neural decision is explainable and auditable for regulatory compliance

3. **Progressive Rigor Levels**
   - Allow users to specify determinism levels from 0% (pure neural flexibility) to 100% (pure symbolic rigor) per workflow step
   - Provide runtime control over neural-symbolic balance without changing workflow specification
   - Enable gradual tightening of constraints as domain understanding evolves

4. **Deterministic Reproducibility**
   - Same workflow specification with same inputs yields identical execution paths and outputs
   - Complete audit trail of every decision, verification, and state change
   - Versioned workflow specifications with clear migration paths

5. **Explainable Neural Decisions**
   - Every neural step produces structured explanations suitable for regulatory review
   - Clear documentation of reasoning, evidence used, and confidence levels
   - Domain-appropriate explanation formats for different stakeholder audiences

6. **Failure Recovery with Domain Expertise**
   - Intelligent recovery strategies when symbolic constraints fail or neural outputs deviate
   - Automatic escalation paths and remediation suggestions based on domain knowledge
   - Graceful degradation to human-in-the-loop when automated recovery is insufficient

### Secondary Goals

7. **Zero-Cognitive-Load Runtime**
   - All intelligent processing complexity absorbed by the runtime
   - Automatic handling of context injection, fault tolerance, and adaptive learning
   - Transparent resource management including tool access, database connections, and user interactions

8. **First-Class User Interaction**
   - User input treated as any other workflow resource with consistent access patterns
   - Natural integration of human clarification, approval, and decision points
   - Automatic context preservation across user interaction boundaries

## Architecture: Clear Separation of Responsibilities

### **Workflow vs POET: Core Relationship**

**POET** = **Intelligent Function Enhancement**
- Adds context injection, fault tolerance, output validation, adaptive learning
- Works on individual functions OR workflows
- Always active when you use `@poet()`

**Workflow** = **Pipeline Creation**
- Combines functions using Dana's `|` operator to create workflows
- Creates a single callable from multiple steps
- The result is just another function (that can be POETed too!)

### Core Concept

A workflow is a composed function created using Dana's `|` operator:

```dana
# Individual functions
def step1(data): return process(data)
def step2(data): return analyze(data)
def step3(data): return report(data)

# Workflow creates a composed function
workflow = step1 | step2 | step3

# Can be called like any function
result = workflow(input_data)

# The beautiful relationship: workflows can be POETed too!
@poet(domain="enterprise_workflow")
def enhanced_workflow = step1 | step2 | step3
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Individual Functions"
        A1["@poet()<br/>function1"] --> B1["Enhanced with<br/>- Context injection<br/>- Fault tolerance<br/>- Output validation"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Workflows"
        A2["Workflow Creation<br/>step1 | step2 | step3"] --> B2["Workflow<br/>(can be called like<br/>any other function)"]
        B2 --> C2["@poet() can enhance<br/>the workflow"]
    end
    
    A1 -.-> A2
    B1 -.-> C2
    
    style A1 fill:#e3f2fd
    style B1 fill:#e3f2fd
    style A2 fill:#f3e5f5
    style B2 fill:#f3e5f5
    style C2 fill:#fff3e0
```

### The Beautiful Relationship: POET + Workflow

#### POET Enhancement
**Always Active**: Every @poet() decorated function has intelligent processing regardless of how it's called.

**What POET Provides:**
- **P**erceive: Context injection & normalization (`"excellent"` → 780, `"$50K"` → 50000)
- **O**perate: Deterministic execution with fault tolerance
- **E**nforce: Output formatting, validation, and structured results
- **T**rain: Learning from execution patterns to improve over time

```dana
@poet(domain="document_processing", retries=3)
def ingest_document(file_path: str) -> Document:
    """Function enhanced with intelligent processing"""
    # Has context injection, fault tolerance, output validation, adaptive learning
    # Works whether called directly OR as part of a workflow
    return Document(file_path)
```

#### Workflow Creation
**Pure Composition**: Dana's `|` operator creates workflows from individual functions.

**What Workflows Provide:**
- Combine multiple functions into a single callable
- Sequential execution with data flow
- The result is just another function
- Can be enhanced with POET too!

```dana
# Create workflow
document_pipeline = ingest_document | analyze_content | generate_report

# Enhance the entire workflow
@poet(domain="enterprise_pipeline")
def enhanced_pipeline = ingest_document | analyze_content | generate_report
```

#### WorkflowEngine - Advanced Orchestration (Optional)
**When needed**: For complex workflows requiring cross-step context and validation.

**What WorkflowEngine Provides:**
- Cross-function context sharing
- Pipeline-level safety validation
- Advanced error handling and recovery
- Audit trails and monitoring

### Solution Options

### Option 1: Intelligent Step Engine (Dana Pipeline-Based)

**Core Concept:** Leverage Dana's architecture where @poet() provides intelligent function enhancement, | provides workflow composition, and WorkflowEngine provides optional orchestration.

**Architecture:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User Functions with
    @poet()"] --> B["Automatic Enhancement"]
    B --> C["Enhanced Functions"]
    C --> D["| Composition"]
    D --> E{Complex Pipeline?}
    E -->|Yes| F[WorkflowEngine Activation]
    E -->|No| G[Direct Execution]
    F --> H[Orchestrated Execution]
    G --> H
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e3f2fd
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style F fill:#c8e6c9
    style G fill:#ffebee
```

**Dana Pipeline Implementation:**
```dana
# User specifies workflow using natural language + @poet()
@poet(domain="invoice_processing", retries=3)
def analyze_invoice(invoice_data):
    """Extract financial data from invoice with domain expertise"""
    return neural_extract(invoice_data)

@poet(domain="compliance", validate_output=True)
def validate_compliance(analysis):
    """Ensure invoice meets regulatory requirements"""
    return validate_against_rules(analysis)

@poet(domain="entity_extraction")
def extract_entities(analysis):
    """Extract key entities from invoice analysis"""
    return extract_key_data(analysis)

# Simple composition - WorkflowEngine activates automatically
invoice_workflow = analyze_invoice | validate_compliance | extract_entities

# Direct execution - each function has full POET behaviors
result = invoice_workflow(invoice_data)

# Individual function call - still has POET enhancement
single_result = analyze_invoice(invoice_data)  # Full POET capabilities active

# Complex workflow triggers orchestration
complex_workflow = (
    analyze_invoice | validate_compliance | 
    extract_entities | generate_report | 
    send_notifications | archive_document
)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Clean separation**: POET enhances functions, Workflow creates pipelines
- **Always-on POET**: Every @poet() function has intelligent processing regardless of invocation context
- **Workflows are functions**: Created with `|` operator, can be POETed like any function
- **Zero learning curve**: Developers write normal functions with @poet(), compose with `|`
- **Intelligent capabilities**: Context injection, fault tolerance, output validation, adaptive learning
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, add WorkflowEngine orchestration when needed

**Pros:** 
- Natural Dana development experience
- Consistent patterns (same @poet() works on functions and workflows)
- No boilerplate or configuration complexity
- Seamless progression from simple functions to complex workflows
- Full auditability without explicit tracking

**Cons:** 
- Advanced orchestration features require WorkflowEngine understanding
- Learning behavior may need tuning for specific domains

### Option 2: Declarative Workflow Compiler

**Core Concept:** Natural language workflow specification compiles to deterministic state machine with intelligent processing, ensuring reliable determinism while preserving adaptive capabilities.

**Architecture:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Natural Language Spec] --> B[Compiler]
    B --> C[State Machine + Neural Subroutines]
    
    B --> D[Static Analysis]
    D --> E[Type Checking]
    E --> F[Safety Verification]
    
    F --> G[Deterministic Execution Plan]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style G fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fff3e0
    style F fill:#fff3e0
```

**Key Features:**
- Compiler ensures all paths are deterministic and explainable
- Neural subroutines only in explicitly marked "flexible" steps
- Static analysis catches specification issues before runtime
- Generated code includes full audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Zero runtime surprises through compile-time verification

**Pros:** Maximum determinism, compile-time safety, optimal performance
**Cons:** Less runtime flexibility, complex compiler implementation

### Option 3: Progressive Rigor Pipeline

**Core Concept:** Start with neural flexibility, progressively add symbolic constraints based on observed behavior, enabling gradual transition from exploration to production-grade determinism.

**Architecture:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial Neural Workflow] --> B[Monitor Success]
    B --> C[Add Constraints]
    C --> D[Rerun]
    D --> B
    
    B --> E[Success Metrics]
    C --> F[Symbolic Rule Generation]
    
    E --> G[Final Deterministic Workflow]
    F --> G
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#c8e6c9
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#f3e5f5
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Key Features:**
- Begin with pure neural execution for maximum flexibility
- Runtime learns which constraints are needed for consistency
- User can "lock in" constraints at any point during development
- Gradual transition from flexible exploration to deterministic production
- Perfect for iterative refinement with domain experts

**Pros:** Natural development workflow, learns from actual usage patterns
**Cons:** Requires initial "training" phase, potential for specification drift

4. **NOT: Visual workflow designer** - Text-based specification only, no drag-and-drop interfaces
5. **NOT: Workflow versioning and migration** - Simple replace-and-restart model for updates
6. **NOT: Performance optimization** - Correctness and compliance over execution speed
7. **NOT: Advanced LLM routing** - Single LLM provider and model per workflow instance
8. **NOT: Multi-tenant isolation** - Single organization, single workflow execution context
9. **NOT: Workflow marketplace** - No sharing, selling, or reusing workflows between organizations
10. **NOT: Dynamic workflow generation** - Workflows are pre-defined and validated before execution

### Deferred Goals (Post-v1.0)

- **Parallel execution** within workflows for performance optimization
- **Workflow templates** across similar domains or use cases
- **Visual debugging tools** for complex workflow analysis

### KISS/YAGNI Focus

**Build exclusively for:** "Single enterprise workflow, single domain expert, single runtime, single LLM, maximum correctness and compliance"

All features beyond this scope are explicitly deferred until demonstrated through real enterprise usage patterns and user feedback.

## Use Case Validation

### Objective Specification Evolution

#### 1. POET-Inferred Objectives (v1.0)
```dana
# Runtime generates objectives from context
@poet
def analyze_invoice(invoice: InvoiceData) -> InvoiceAnalysis:
    # POET infers: "Extract financial data per domain rules"
    # Generates validation criteria automatically
    # Documents for user review/editing
    return neural_execute_with_context(
        context=curated_domain_knowledge,
        validation=auto_generated_rules
    )
```

#### 2. Efficiency-Driven Verification
```dana
# Symbolic-first optimization
efficient_workflow = (
    try_symbolic_only |
    [success, fallback_to_neural] |
    skip_verification_if_confidence_high |
    [continue, add_light_validation]
)

# Risk-based bypass
smart_validation = (
    assess_risk_level |
    [skip_verification, light_validation, full_validation] |
    adaptive_verification_based_on_context
)
```

#### 3. Combined P-E Optimization
```dana
# Combined validation + next planning
@poet
def combined_validator_planner(result_f1, context_f2):
    """
    Validate f1 completion AND determine f2 requirements
    Returns: (f1_success, f2_planning, required_context)
    """
    return reason(
        "Is f1 objective met? What context/tools needed for f2?",
