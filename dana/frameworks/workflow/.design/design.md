## Problem Statement

Industrial, financial, and enterprise environments require agentic workflows that combine the robustness and flexibility of neural approaches with the reproducibility, explainability, and determinism demanded by regulated domains. Currently, AI engineers must choose between:

- **Neural-only approaches** that offer flexibility but lack transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance
- **Symbolic-only approaches** that provide determinism but cannot handle edge cases or incomplete specifications
- **Manual orchestration** that places unsustainable cognitive load on engineers who understand domain processes but not AI/ML internals

The critical gap is the absence of a system that enables **domain experts** (process engineers, compliance officers, subject matter experts) to encode their well-defined, regulated workflows using **natural language specifications** while the **runtime guarantees** reproducibility, provides full explainability, and maintains deterministic control over all execution paths.

**How might we enable domain experts to specify enterprise-grade agentic workflows at the right level of abstraction—declarative enough for reliability and transparency, yet flexible enough for neural adaptability—while the runtime absorbs all complexity of neurosymbolic coordination, verification, and state management?**

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Domain Expert Workflow Specification**
   - Enable subject matter experts to specify workflows using natural language descriptions of their business processes
   - No requirement for AI/ML knowledge, prompting expertise, or technical implementation details
   - Support for regulatory requirements, compliance checks, and domain-specific constraints

2. **Neural Flexibility with Symbolic Guarantees**
   - Leverage LLM robustness for handling edge cases, incomplete specifications, and creative problem-solving
   - Provide deterministic guarantees through symbolic validation at every workflow step
   - Ensure every neural decision is explainable and auditable for regulatory compliance

3. **Progressive Rigor Levels**
   - Allow users to specify determinism levels from 0% (pure neural flexibility) to 100% (pure symbolic rigor) per workflow step
   - Provide runtime control over neural-symbolic balance without changing workflow specification
   - Enable gradual tightening of constraints as domain understanding evolves

4. **Deterministic Reproducibility**
   - Same workflow specification with same inputs yields identical execution paths and outputs
   - Complete audit trail of every decision, verification, and state change
   - Versioned workflow specifications with clear migration paths

5. **Explainable Neural Decisions**
   - Every neural step produces structured explanations suitable for regulatory review
   - Clear documentation of reasoning, evidence used, and confidence levels
   - Domain-appropriate explanation formats for different stakeholder audiences

6. **Failure Recovery with Domain Expertise**
   - Intelligent recovery strategies when symbolic constraints fail or neural outputs deviate
   - Automatic escalation paths and remediation suggestions based on domain knowledge
   - Graceful degradation to human-in-the-loop when automated recovery is insufficient

### Secondary Goals

7. **Zero-Cognitive-Load Runtime**
   - All neurosymbolic coordination complexity absorbed by the runtime
   - Automatic handling of LLM rate limits, retries, context management, and error handling
   - Transparent resource management including tool access, database connections, and user interactions

8. **First-Class User Interaction**
   - User input treated as any other workflow resource with consistent access patterns
   - Natural integration of human clarification, approval, and decision points
   - Automatic context preservation across user interaction boundaries

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Neural-Symbolic Step Engine (Dana Pipeline-Based)

**Core Concept:** Leverage Dana's function composition system to create neurosymbolic step engines that combine neural execution with symbolic validation in deterministic pipelines.

**Architecture:**

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
    style G fill:#ffebee
    style K fill:#ffebee
    style M fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Dana Pipeline Implementation:**
```dana
# User specifies workflow declaratively
workflow = (
    analyze_invoice as step1 | 
    validate_compliance as step1_validation |
    extract_entities as step2 |
    verify_entities as step2_validation |
    generate_report as final_step
)

# Runtime compiles to neurosymbolic pipeline
compiled_workflow = (
    neural_execute(analyze_invoice) | symbolic_validate(compliance_rules) |
    neural_execute(extract_entities) | symbolic_validate(entity_schema) |
    neural_execute(generate_report) | symbolic_validate(report_format)
)

# Execution with automatic state capture
result = compiled_workflow(invoice_data) as audit_trail
```

**Key Features:**
- **Dana-native**: Leverages existing pipeline composition system
- **Explicit contracts**: Each step has clear neural objective + symbolic constraints
- **Automatic state capture**: `as result_name` captures intermediate states for audit trails
- **Deterministic execution**: Pipeline ensures consistent step ordering despite neural components
- **Failure recovery**: Failed validations trigger recovery handlers within pipeline structure
- **Progressive rigor**: Users can mark steps as `strict` or `flexible` within same pipeline

**Pros:** Built on proven Dana composition, natural for Dana users, automatic state management
**Cons:** Requires understanding of Dana pipeline syntax, performance overhead from validation gates

### Option 2: Declarative Workflow Compiler

**Core Concept:** Natural language workflow specification compiles to deterministic state machine with neural subroutines, ensuring enterprise-grade determinism while preserving neural capabilities.

**Architecture:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Natural Language Spec] --> B[Compiler]
    B --> C[State Machine + Neural Subroutines]
    
    B --> D[Static Analysis]
    D --> E[Type Checking]
    E --> F[Safety Verification]
    
    F --> G[Deterministic Execution Plan]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style G fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#fff3e0
    style F fill:#fff3e0
```

**Key Features:**
- Compiler ensures all paths are deterministic and explainable
- Neural subroutines only in explicitly marked "flexible" steps
- Static analysis catches specification issues before runtime
- Generated code includes full audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Zero runtime surprises through compile-time verification

**Pros:** Maximum determinism, compile-time safety, optimal performance
**Cons:** Less runtime flexibility, complex compiler implementation

### Option 3: Progressive Rigor Pipeline

**Core Concept:** Start with neural flexibility, progressively add symbolic constraints based on observed behavior, enabling gradual transition from exploration to production-grade determinism.

**Architecture:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial Neural Workflow] --> B[Monitor Success]
    B --> C[Add Constraints]
    C --> D[Rerun]
    D --> B
    
    B --> E[Success Metrics]
    C --> F[Symbolic Rule Generation]
    
    E --> G[Final Deterministic Workflow]
    F --> G
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#c8e6c9
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#f3e5f5
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Key Features:**
- Begin with pure neural execution for maximum flexibility
- Runtime learns which constraints are needed for consistency
- User can "lock in" constraints at any point during development
- Gradual transition from flexible exploration to deterministic production
- Perfect for iterative refinement with domain experts

**Pros:** Natural development workflow, learns from actual usage patterns
**Cons:** Requires initial "training" phase, potential for specification drift

### Objective Specification Evolution

#### 1. POET-Inferred Objectives (v1.0)
```dana
# Runtime generates objectives from context
@poet
def analyze_invoice(invoice: InvoiceData) -> InvoiceAnalysis:
    # POET infers: "Extract financial data per domain rules"
    # Generates validation criteria automatically
    # Documents for user review/editing

        context=curated_domain_knowledge,
        validation=auto_generated_rules
    )
```

#### 2. Efficiency-Driven Verification

efficient_workflow = (
    try_symbolic_only |
    [success, fallback_to_neural] |
    skip_verification_if_confidence_high |
    [continue, add_light_validation]
)

# Risk-based bypass
smart_validation = (
    assess_risk_level |
    [skip_verification, light_validation, full_validation] |
    adaptive_verification_based_on_context
)
```

#### 3. Combined P-E Optimization

@poet
def combined_validator_planner(result_f1, context_f2):
    """
    Validate f1 completion AND determine f2 requirements
    Returns: (f1_success, f2_planning, required_context)
    """
    return reason(
        "Is f1 objective met? What context/tools needed for f2?",
