# Objective-Driven Agent State Machine with POET Architecture

## Overview

This design demonstrates how to build an **executable state machine** using DanaFunctions with explicit objectives and the POET (Perceive-Operate-Enforce-Train) architecture. Each function has a clear `objective=` parameter and `optimize_for=` target, enabling systematic problem-solving with continuous learning.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Objective-Driven Functions
Every DanaFunction has explicit objectives that define what it's trying to achieve:

```dana
@poet(domain="semiconductor", objective="analyze_process_data", optimize_for="accuracy")
def analyze_process_data(agent: ObjectiveDrivenAgent, data: ProcessData) -> AnalysisResult:
    """Analyze semiconductor process data to identify patterns and anomalies."""
    # Function implementation with clear objective
```

### 2. POET Enhancement
The `@poet` decorator provides the P→O→E→T pipeline:
- **P (Perceive)**: Input validation and context preparation
- **O (Operate)**: Core business logic execution
- **E (Enforce)**: Output validation and quality assurance
- **T (Train)**: Optional learning and improvement

### 3. State Machine Pattern
Functions transition through well-defined states:
```
idle → analyzing → diagnosing → optimizing → validating → reporting → idle
```

## Architecture Components

### Agent Structure
```dana
agent ObjectiveDrivenAgent:
    current_state: str = "idle"
    current_objective: str = "wait_for_task"
    domains: list[str] = ["Semiconductor Manufacturing", ...]
    tasks: list[str] = ["Analyze Process Data", ...]
    state_transitions: dict[str, str] = {...}
```

### State Machine Functions
1. **`analyze_process_data`** - Objective: Extract insights from raw data
2. **`diagnose_root_causes`** - Objective: Determine underlying causes
3. **`optimize_process_parameters`** - Objective: Improve efficiency
4. **`validate_optimization`** - Objective: Ensure safety and effectiveness
5. **`generate_execution_report`** - Objective: Communicate results
6. **`execute_state_machine`** - Objective: Orchestrate the complete process

### Data Structures
- **`ProcessData`**: Raw manufacturing data
- **`AnalysisResult`**: Pattern, anomaly, and trend analysis
- **`DiagnosisResult`**: Root cause identification
- **`OptimizationResult`**: Parameter optimization
- **`ValidationResult`**: Safety and performance validation
- **`ExecutionResult`**: Complete state machine results

## Key Benefits

### 1. Explicit Objectives
Each function knows exactly what it's trying to achieve:
- `objective="analyze_process_data"` - Clear purpose
- `optimize_for="accuracy"` - Specific optimization target

### 2. POET Reliability
Automatic enhancement through the POET pipeline:
- **Perceive**: Domain-specific input processing
- **Operate**: Reliable execution with retry logic
- **Enforce**: Output validation and compliance
- **Train**: Continuous learning from feedback

### 3. Traceable State Transitions
Clear progression through problem-solving phases:
```dana
agent.current_state = "analyzing"
agent.current_objective = "identify_data_patterns"
```

### 4. Domain Intelligence
POET domain plugins provide industry-specific expertise:
- Semiconductor manufacturing knowledge
- Process optimization algorithms
- Safety and compliance validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Problem Solving
```dana
# Define a manufacturing problem
problem = ManufacturingProblem(
    problem_type="quality_degradation",
    description="Yield has dropped from 95% to 87%",
    affected_equipment=["RIE_Chamber_01"],
    urgency="high"
)

# Solve using objective-driven state machine
solution = solve(agent, problem)
```

### Direct State Machine Execution
```dana
# Execute state machine with process data
execution_result = execute_state_machine(agent, process_data)

# Check results for each phase
for phase_name, phase_result in execution_result.results.items():
    print(f"{phase_name}: {phase_result}")
```

### Individual Function Execution
```dana
# Execute specific phases with objectives
analysis = analyze_process_data(agent, data)      # Objective: accuracy
diagnosis = diagnose_root_causes(agent, analysis) # Objective: speed
optimization = optimize_process_parameters(agent, diagnosis) # Objective: efficiency
```

## Implementation Details

### POET Configuration
Each function uses domain-specific POET configuration:
```dana
@poet(
    domain="semiconductor",           # Industry domain
    objective="analyze_process_data", # Function objective
    optimize_for="accuracy",          # Optimization target
    retries=3,                        # Reliability settings
    timeout=30.0,
    enable_training=true              # Learning enabled
)
```

### State Management
Agent state is updated throughout execution:
```dana
def analyze_process_data(agent: ObjectiveDrivenAgent, data: ProcessData):
    agent.current_state = "analyzing"
    agent.current_objective = "identify_data_patterns"
    # ... function logic
```

### Error Handling
POET provides automatic error handling and retry logic:
- Automatic retries on failure
- Timeout protection
- Domain-specific error recovery
- Graceful degradation

### Learning and Feedback
The T-stage enables continuous improvement:
- Parameter optimization based on execution patterns
- Feedback collection and processing
- Performance monitoring and adjustment

## Extensibility

### Adding New States
To add new states to the state machine:

1. **Define the state function**:
```dana
@poet(domain="semiconductor", objective="new_phase", optimize_for="specific_target")
def new_phase_function(agent: ObjectiveDrivenAgent, input_data) -> OutputType:
    agent.current_state = "new_phase"
    agent.current_objective = "new_objective"
    # Implementation
```

2. **Update state transitions**:
```dana
state_transitions: dict[str, str] = {
    "idle": "analyzing",
    "analyzing": "new_phase",  # Add new transition
    "new_phase": "diagnosing", # Add new transition
    # ... rest of transitions
}
```

3. **Update orchestrator**:
```dana
def execute_state_machine(agent: ObjectiveDrivenAgent, initial_data):
    # ... existing phases
    new_phase_result = new_phase_function(agent, previous_result)
    results["new_phase"] = new_phase_result
    # ... continue with next phases
```

### Adding New Domains
To support new domains:

1. **Create domain-specific POET plugin**
2. **Update agent domains list**
3. **Add domain-specific data structures**
4. **Implement domain-specific logic**

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Objectives

### 2. Optimization Targets
- Choose appropriate optimization targets

- Consider domain-specific requirements

### 3. State Management
- Keep state transitions simple and predictable
- Validate state changes
- Provide clear state documentation

### 4. Error Handling

- Add domain-specific error recovery
- Provide meaningful error messages

### 5. Testing
- Test individual functions with objectives
