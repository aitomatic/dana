Rule 5 - Look-out:
- Maintain proper look-out by sight and hearing
- Use all available means appropriate
- Assess risk of collision

Rule 6 - Safe Speed:
- Maintain safe speed for prevailing conditions
- Consider visibility, traffic density, maneuverability
- Account for stopping distance and turning ability

Rule 7 - Risk of Collision:
- Use all available means to assess risk
- Consider relative bearing changes
- Monitor distance between vessels

Rule 8 - Action to Avoid Collision:
- Take early and substantial action
- Avoid small course and speed changes
- Make action clear to other vessel

Rule 9 - Narrow Channels:
- Keep to starboard side of channel
- Avoid crossing if impeding other vessels
- Small vessels and fishing vessels keep clear

Rule 10 - Traffic Separation Schemes:
- Follow established traffic lanes
- Cross lanes at right angles
- Avoid anchoring in traffic lanes

Section II - Conduct of Vessels in Sight of One Another:
========================================================

Rule 11 - Application:
- Rules apply when vessels in sight
- Both vessels can see each other
- Visual observation possible

Rule 12 - Sailing Vessels:
- Port tack gives way to starboard tack
- Windward vessel gives way to leeward
- Overtaking vessel keeps clear

Rule 13 - Overtaking:
- Any vessel overtaking keeps clear
- Overtaking vessel maintains course and speed
- Stand-on vessel maintains course and speed

Rule 14 - Head-on Situation:
- Both vessels alter course to starboard
- Pass port-to-port when safe
- Early and substantial action required

Rule 15 - Crossing Situation:
- Vessel with other on starboard gives way
- Stand-on vessel maintains course and speed
- Give-way vessel takes early action

Rule 16 - Action by Give-way Vessel:
- Take early and substantial action
- Avoid crossing ahead of stand-on vessel
- Consider maneuverability limitations

Rule 17 - Action by Stand-on Vessel:
- Maintain course and speed
- May take action if give-way fails
- Must act when collision cannot be avoided

Rule 18 - Responsibilities Between Vessels:
- Power-driven vessels give way to:
  * Vessels not under command
  * Vessels restricted in ability to maneuver
  * Vessels constrained by draft
  * Fishing vessels actively fishing
  * Sailing vessels
- Sailing vessels give way to:
  * Vessels not under command
  * Vessels restricted in ability to maneuver
  * Vessels constrained by draft
  * Fishing vessels actively fishing

Section III - Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility:
=========================================================

Rule 19 - Conduct in Restricted Visibility:
- Proceed at safe speed for conditions
- Have engines ready for immediate maneuver
- Take action to avoid collision
- Consider radar limitations

Rule 20 - Application:
- Rules apply in restricted visibility
- Both vessels must take action
- No stand-on vessel in fog

Rule 21 - Definitions:
- Vessel not under command: unable to maneuver
- Vessel restricted in ability to maneuver: limited maneuverability
