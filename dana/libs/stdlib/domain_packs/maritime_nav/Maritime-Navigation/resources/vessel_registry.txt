Vessel Classification by Right of Way:
======================================

Stand-on Vessels (Higher Priority):

- Vessels not under command
- Vessels restricted in ability to maneuver
- Vessels constrained by draft
- Pilot vessels on duty

Give-way Vessels (Lower Priority):
- Power-driven vessels
- Sailing vessels
- Vessels engaged in fishing (when not actively fishing)
- Pleasure craft

Maneuverability Ratings:
========================

Very High:
- Pilot vessels, pleasure craft, fishing vessels
- Excellent stopping and turning capabilities
- Can make rapid course and speed changes

High:
- Small commercial vessels
- Good maneuverability in most conditions
- Reasonable stopping and turning capabilities

Medium:
- Medium-sized commercial vessels
- Moderate maneuverability
- Adequate stopping and turning capabilities

Low:
- Large commercial vessels (tankers, bulk carriers)
- Limited maneuverability
- Long stopping distances and turning radii
- Require early action for collision avoidance
