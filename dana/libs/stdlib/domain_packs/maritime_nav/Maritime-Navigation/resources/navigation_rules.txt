MARITIME NAVIGATION RULES AND CALCULATIONS
==========================================

Collision Avoidance Rules (COLREGS):
====================================

Rule 13 - Overtaking:
- A vessel overtaking another shall keep out of the way
- Overtaking vessel must pass at a safe distance
- Stand-on vessel maintains course and speed

Rule 14 - Head-on Situation:
- Both vessels alter course to starboard
- Pass port-to-port when safe and practicable
- Early and substantial action required

Rule 15 - Crossing Situation:
- Vessel with other on starboard side gives way
- Stand-on vessel maintains course and speed
- Give-way vessel takes early and substantial action

Rule 16 - Action by Give-way Vessel:
- Take early and substantial action to avoid collision
- Avoid crossing ahead of stand-on vessel
- Consider maneuverability limitations

Rule 17 - Action by Stand-on Vessel:
- Maintain course and speed
- May take action if give-way vessel fails to act
- Must take action when collision cannot be avoided

Right of Way Hierarchy:
=======================

1. Vessels not under command
2. Vessels restricted in ability to maneuver
3. Vessels constrained by draft
4. Fishing vessels actively fishing
5. Sailing vessels
6. Power-driven vessels

Collision Risk Assessment:
==========================

High Risk Indicators:
- CPA < 0.5 nautical miles
- Time to CPA < 10 minutes
- Vessels on collision course
- Poor visibility conditions
- High relative speeds

Medium Risk Indicators:
- CPA 0.5 - 1.0 nautical miles
- Time to CPA 10-20 minutes
- Vessels on near-collision course
- Moderate visibility conditions
- Moderate relative speeds

Low Risk Indicators:
- CPA > 1.0 nautical miles
- Time to CPA > 20 minutes
- Vessels passing safely
- Good visibility conditions
- Low relative speeds

Safe Passing Distances:
=======================

Open Sea:
- Large vessels: 1.0+ nautical miles
- Medium vessels: 0.5+ nautical miles
- Small vessels: 0.3+ nautical miles

Restricted Waters:
- Large vessels: 0.5+ nautical miles
- Medium vessels: 0.3+ nautical miles
- Small vessels: 0.2+ nautical miles

Harbor/Port Areas:
- All vessels: 0.2+ nautical miles
- Consider local regulations
- Account for traffic density

Relative Motion Calculations:
============================

Distance Calculation:
- Use GPS coordinates or radar data
- Calculate straight-line distance
- Consider chart accuracy and errors

Bearing Calculation:
- True bearing from Vessel A to Vessel B
- Account for magnetic variation
- Use compass or GPS bearing

Relative Speed:
- Difference between vessel speeds
- Consider course convergence
- Calculate closing speed

CPA (Closest Point of Approach):
- Minimum distance vessels will pass
- Based on current courses and speeds
- Time to reach CPA point

Time to CPA:
- Distance to CPA divided by closing speed
- Critical for decision-making
- Minimum safe reaction time: 10 minutes

Maneuvering Recommendations:
============================

Course Changes:
- Minimum course change: 15 degrees
- Preferred course change: 30-45 degrees
- Make changes early and substantial
- Consider traffic separation schemes

Speed Changes:
- Reduce speed to increase time for safe passage
- Consider vessel maneuverability
- Maintain safe speed for conditions
- Account for stopping distance

Communication Requirements:
==========================

VHF Radio:
- Channel 16 for distress and safety
- Channel 13 for bridge-to-bridge
- Channel 10 for port operations
- Use proper maritime language

Signals:
- Sound signals for maneuvering
- Visual signals for identification
- Emergency signals for distress
- Follow international standards

Monitoring and Reassessment:
============================

Continuous Monitoring:
- Track relative position changes
- Monitor course and speed changes
- Assess effectiveness of actions
- Prepare contingency plans

Reassessment Timing:
- Every 2-3 minutes in high-risk situations
- Every 5-10 minutes in medium-risk situations
- Every 15-20 minutes in low-risk situations
- Immediately if situation changes
