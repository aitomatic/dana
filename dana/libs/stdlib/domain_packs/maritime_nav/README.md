### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd maritime_nav

# Install dependencies using UV

# Or using pip
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Running the Maritime Navigation System

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
./Maritime-Navigation/run-maritime-navigation

### Knowledge Resources

The system leverages five specialized knowledge databases:

1. **Vessel Registry** (`vessel_registry.txt`)
   - Vessel specifications, maneuverability ratings
   - Right of way classifications
   - Stopping distances and turning radii

2. **COLREGS Database** (`colregs_database.txt`)
   - International collision regulations
   - Right of way hierarchy
   - Communication and signal requirements

3. **Environmental Data** (`environmental_data.txt`)
   - Weather conditions and sea states
   - Visibility and seasonal variations
   - Risk assessment matrices

4. **Navigation Rules** (`navigation_rules.txt`)
   - Collision risk assessment criteria
   - Safe passing distances
   - Relative motion calculations

5. **Historical Incidents** (`historical_incidents.txt`)
   - Documented collision scenarios
   - Success patterns and failure analysis
   - Recommended actions by vessel type

## Analysis Workflow

The system follows a structured 4-step analysis process:

### 1. **Vessel Identification & Capability Assessment**

- Maps vessel IDs to specifications and capabilities
- Assesses maneuverability and right of way status
- Determines operational limitations

### 2. **Current Situation Analysis**

- Analyzes relative motion and collision risk
- Calculates closest point of approach (CPA)
- Assesses time to closest point of approach (TCPA)

### 3. **Environmental & Regulatory Context**

- Evaluates weather and sea conditions
- Applies COLREGS rules and requirements
- Considers traffic density and visibility

### 4. **Historical Pattern Correlation & Decision Recommendation**

- Searches for similar historical scenarios
- Provides evidence-based recommendations
- Generates specific course and speed actions

## Supported Vessel Types

- **Bulk Carriers**: MV CargoStar, MV TankerPro
- **Oil Tankers**: MV TankerPro
