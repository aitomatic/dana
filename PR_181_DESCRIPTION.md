## 📊 **What the Simulations Do**

### **Knowledge Evolution Simulation**

This simulation demonstrates how KNOWS transforms knowledge-intensive processes through iterative learning:

1. **Initial Setup**: Creates basic knowledge base with documentary knowledge
2. **5 Iterations**: Each iteration runs the complete CORRAL lifecycle
3. **Performance Tracking**: Measures success rates, response times, and satisfaction
4. **Knowledge Growth**: Tracks new knowledge creation and promotion
5. **Final Analysis**: Compares results with traditional RAG approaches

### **CORRAL Lifecycle Phases**

Each iteration executes all 6 phases:

1. **CURATE**: Analyzes requirements and identifies knowledge needs
2. **ORGANIZE**: Creates knowledge units and stores them appropriately
3. **RETRIEVE**: Selects relevant knowledge for the current task
4. **REASON**: Composes knowledge into actionable insights
5. **ACT**: Executes the task using composed knowledge
6. **LEARN**: Analyzes outcomes and updates the knowledge base

### **Business Scenarios**

#### **Semiconductor Packaging**
- **Challenge**: Calibrating vision system for BGA packages with non-standard fiducial patterns
- **Requirements**: ±0.1mm accuracy, High-Tg FR4 substrate material
- **Goal**: Reduce setup time from 2-3 days to 4-6 hours

#### **IC Design FAE Support**
- **Challenge**: Supporting medical device customers with power management IC implementation
- **Requirements**: FDA Class III compliance, ultra-low power, 99.99% reliability
- **Goal**: Improve support success rates and customer satisfaction

```

**What This Means**: The system creates new knowledge and improves existing knowledge through experience.

#### **Knowledge Maturity Analysis**
```
🔰 Basic Knowledge: 1 iterations
🔄 Enhanced Knowledge: 2 iterations
🎯 Mature Knowledge: 2 iterations
```

**What This Means**: Knowledge progresses from basic documentary knowledge to mature experiential knowledge.

### **RAG Comparison Results**

```
📊 Success Rate: Traditional RAG 65.0% → KNOWS 93.5% (+44%)
⏱️  Response Time: Traditional RAG 90min → KNOWS 52min (-42%)
😊 Customer Satisfaction: Traditional RAG 60.0% → KNOWS 95.0% (+58%)
```

**What This Means**: KNOWS significantly outperforms traditional RAG systems in all key metrics.

### **Business Value Interpretation**
