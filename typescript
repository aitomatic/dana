    - How to normalize, tag, and validate
    2. DATA STRUCTURES:
    - What structured representations should be created (e.g., LogTable, DefectGraph)
    - How each relates to the knowledge assets
    3. STORAGE FORMATS:
    - Which store is best for each structure: [vector, RDBMS, KV-pair, graph]
    - Rationale and access patterns
    4. QUERY PATTERNS:
    - How an agent queries these at runtime (e.g., "Given a symptom, find matching root causes")
    - Optimization (caching, fallback strategies)
    5. PERFORMANCE NOTES:
    - Expected latency, throughput, quality confidence
    - Resource and scale notes
