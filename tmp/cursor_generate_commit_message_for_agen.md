# Agent Framework PR

## Description
<!-- What agent functionality are you adding/fixing? -->

## Type of Change
- [ ] üß† New agent capability
- [ ] üîå New resource integration  
- [ ] üêõ Agent behavior fix
- [ ] ‚ö° Performance improvement
- [ ] üîß Lifecycle management

## Agent Components

I'll help you review the documentation and generate a commit message. Let me first examine the file and the latest git commit.

Based on my review of the `docs/designs/mcp-a2a-resources.md` file and the git commit, I can see this is a comprehensive design document for MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) resource integration. Here's a helpful commit message using the provided template:

```markdown
# Agent Framework PR

## Description
Add comprehensive design document for MCP and A2A Resources integration, establishing OpenDXA as a universal agent platform that can both consume external services and provide capabilities to external clients through standardized protocols.

## Type of Change
- [x] üîå New resource integration  
- [x] üß† New agent capability
- [x] üîß Lifecycle management

## Agent Components
- [x] **Resources** - MCP, external APIs, data sources
- [x] **Lifecycle** - Initialization, execution, cleanup
- [x] **Common** - Mixins, utilities, configuration
- [x] **State Management** - Context, persistence, recovery

## Changes
Design document defines bidirectional protocol support for OpenDXA agents to integrate with external MCP servers and A2A agents, while also exposing OpenDXA capabilities as MCP tools and A2A agents to external clients. Key architectural components include:

- **Resource-Centric Approach**: MCP tools and A2A agents as specialized resource types with proper lifecycle management
- **Transport Abstraction**: Auto-detection of STDIO, HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports
- **Context Management**: AbstractContextManager-based resource lifecycle with guaranteed cleanup
- **Security Framework**: Zero-config security defaults with trust levels and context sanitization
- **Bidirectional Integration**: Both client-side consumption and server-side provisioning of protocol services

### Usage Example
```python
# Client-side: Consuming external MCP server
with use("mcp.database") as db:
    result = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true")

# Client-side: Collaborating with A2A agent
with use("a2a.research_agent") as researcher:
    analysis = researcher.collaborate("Analyze market trends", context)

# Server-side: Exposing OpenDXA as MCP/A2A services happens automatically
```

## Testing
- [ ] Added agent capability tests
- [ ] Integration tests with other components
- [ ] Resource connection tests
- [ ] Agent workflow tests: `pytest tests/agent/`
- [ ] Memory/state persistence tested

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run agent tests (when implemented)
pytest tests/agent/
pytest tests/common/resource/mcp/
pytest tests/common/resource/a2a/
```

## Integration
- [x] Works with existing agent capabilities
- [x] Resource properly registered
- [x] No conflicts with other resources
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Logging/monitoring included

## Documentation
- [x] Agent capability documented
- [x] Resource usage examples added
- [x] API documentation updated
- [x] Configuration options documented

**Closes #** <!-- Add issue number if applicable -->
```

This commit message captures the significance of this design document, which establishes a comprehensive framework for protocol integration that positions OpenDXA as both a consumer and provider in the broader AI agent ecosystem, with robust security, lifecycle management, and bidirectional capabilities.
