# LLM Integration Improvements in DANA

## Summary of Changes

The following changes were made to improve LLM resource integration for DANA `reason()` statements:

### 1. Improved Error Handling in InterpreterVisitor

- Fixed the auto-instantiation logic in `_perform_reasoning` to properly handle errors when the LLM resource is not available
- Added proper catching of `StateError` when getting the LLM resource
- Added `await llm.initialize()` to ensure LLM resources are properly initialized
- Enhanced error messages with specific instructions for resolving LLM resource issues
- Added better logging with clear error messages

### 2. Enhanced REPL Resource Management

- Updated `run_repl.py` to check for common API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Groq, Google)
- Added visual indicators (✅, ⚠️) to clearly show LLM initialization status
- Improved error messages with specific instructions for configuring LLM API access
- Added detailed environment variable descriptions and examples

### 3. Documentation Improvements

- Updated the `DANA.md` documentation with comprehensive guidance on LLM resource configuration
- Added detailed sections on:
  - Auto-instantiation behavior
  - Environment variable requirements
  - Configuration file options
  - Manual resource registration
  - Troubleshooting tips

### 4. Example and Configuration Templates

- Created `reason_demo.dana` with examples of different `reason()` statement usage patterns
- Created configuration template `opendxa_config.json` with model preferences
- Added `setup_llm_resource.py` example showing proper LLM resource initialization

## Future Considerations

1. **More Robust Error Recovery**: Further enhance error handling to allow graceful degradation when LLM resources are unavailable
2. **LLM Fallbacks**: Implement a fallback chain for multiple LLM providers
3. **Local LLM Support**: Improve support for local LLMs via Ollama or other providers
4. **Caching**: Add caching for reason() results to reduce API costs and latency
