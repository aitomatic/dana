# DANA REPL Variable Reference Fix

This directory contains test scripts and documentation related to fixing the variable reference issue in the DANA REPL.

## Problem

The DANA REPL was unable to correctly handle variable self-references in expressions. For example:

```
private.a = 1       # Works fine
private.a = private.a + 1  # Failed with "Undefined variable: private.a"
```

## Solution

The solution implemented in `opendxa/dana/runtime/fixes/repl_fix.py` provides:

1. Direct state access fallbacks for variable reference resolution
2. Pattern-based handling for common operations:
   - Self-references: `private.a = private.a + 1`
   - Variable-to-variable operations: `private.c = private.b`
   - Operations with multiple variables: `private.result = private.a + private.b`

## Test Scripts

- `test_repl_fix.py`: Simple test comparing standard and patched REPL behavior
- `test_repl_advanced.py`: More comprehensive tests of variable references

## Usage

The fix is automatically applied when starting the DANA REPL through the standard entrypoint. 
The `bin/run_dana_repl.sh` script launches the REPL with these improvements enabled.

Users can now run expressions like `private.a = private.a + 1` in the REPL without errors.

## Implementation Details

The fix works by:
1. Adding direct state dictionary access fallbacks to variable resolution
2. Pattern matching common expression types using regular expressions
3. Special handling for self-referential expressions and operations
4. Maintaining compatibility with existing tests and expectations

The fix is applied at REPL initialization time by patching several methods:
- `REPL.execute`: For top-level expression handling
- `ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate_identifier`: For identifier resolution
- `ContextManager.get_variable`: For variable lookup
