# Dana Marketing Collateral Creation Prompt

## Executive Summary

You are creating product marketing collateral for **Dana**, the world's first agent-native programming language that represents a paradigm shift in AI development. Dana bridges the gap between AI coding assistants and autonomous agents through a revolutionary convergence approach.

## About Dana: The Agent-Native Revolution

### What is Dana?
Dana (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture) is a universal program format and execution runtime that enables intelligent agents — human or machine — to reason, act, and collaborate through structured, interpretable programs. It serves as the missing link between natural language objectives and tool-assisted, stateful action.

### Core Innovation: Agent-Native Programming
Dana introduces the concept of **agent-native programming** - a fundamental shift from traditional AI development approaches:

- **Write `agent` instead of `class`**: First-class agent primitives built into the language
- **Context-aware `reason()` calls**: AI reasoning that adapts output types automatically based on usage
- **Self-improving pipelines**: Compositional operations that optimize themselves through POET
- **Transparent execution**: Every step visible and debuggable through imperative programming

### 3. The POET Execution Model
Dana's revolutionary **POET (Perceive → Operate → Enforce → Train)** execution model provides enterprise-grade reliability:

```dana
# What Engineers Write (Simple)
@poet(domain="financial_services", retries=3)
def assess_credit_risk(credit_score: int, income: float, debt_ratio: float) -> str:
    if credit_score >= 750 and debt_ratio <= 0.3:
        return "approved"
    elif credit_score >= 650 and debt_ratio <= 0.45:
        return "conditional"
    else:
        return "declined"

# What POET Runtime Automatically Adds:
# P: Input normalization ("excellent"→780, "$50K"→50000, "25%"→0.25)
# O: Retry logic, timeout handling, error recovery
# E: FCRA compliance validation, audit trail generation
