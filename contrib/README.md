# Contrib Directory

This directory contains experimental or contributed code that may not be ready for, or intended for, inclusion in the main codebase. These contributions can include:

- Experimental features or prototypes
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Alternative approaches to problems
- Community contributions that need further review
- Research or academic work based on OpenDXA

## Guidelines

1. Each contribution should be in its own subdirectory with a clear name
2. Include a README.md in each subdirectory explaining:
   - Purpose of the contribution
   - Current status (experimental, proof-of-concept, etc.)
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - How to use/run the code
   - Known limitations or issues

3. Code in this directory is not officially supported and may:
   - Not follow the main project's coding standards
   - Have incomplete documentation
   - Be experimental or unstable
   - Require additional dependencies

4. Contributions here are not guaranteed to be maintained or updated with the main project

## Contributing

If you have code you'd like to contribute:

1. Create a new subdirectory with a descriptive name
2. Include all necessary files and documentation
3. Follow the guidelines above for your contribution's README
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your contribution

Note: Code in this directory is not subject to the same review process as the main codebase, but should still follow basic security and ethical guidelines.
