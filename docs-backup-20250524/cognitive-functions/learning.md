# Learning in OpenDXA

## Overview

Learning in OpenDXA enables agents to improve their performance, adapt to changing environments, and evolve their knowledge over time. Through Dana programs and capabilities, agents can implement various learning mechanisms that enhance their efficacy and domain expertise.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Learning Types
- **Experience-based Learning**
  - Learning from past interactions
  - Tracking performance data
  - Updating strategies based on outcomes
  - Behavioral adaptation

- **Knowledge-based Learning**
  - Updating domain knowledge
  - Evolving conceptual understanding
  - Refining expertise
  - Knowledge validation and correction

- **Feedback-based Learning**
  - User feedback integration
  - Performance feedback processing
  - Correction mechanisms
  - Continuous improvement cycles

### 2. Learning Operations
- Feedback collection
- Performance analysis
- Knowledge evolution
- Strategy adaptation
- Hypothesis testing

## Implementation with Dana

### 1. Experience-based Learning
```python
# Dana program for experience-based learning
experience_learning = """
# Track interaction experience
temp.interaction = world.current_interaction
temp.outcome = world.interaction_outcome
temp.strategy = agent.current_strategy

# Store interaction in memory
temp.memory_params = {
    "key": "interaction_" + generate_id(),
    "value": {
        "interaction": temp.interaction,
        "strategy": temp.strategy,
        "outcome": temp.outcome,
        "timestamp": current_time()
    }
}
use_capability("memory", "store", temp.memory_params)

# Analyze past interactions with similar context
temp.similar_params = {
    "query": "interaction context similar to " + temp.interaction.context,
    "limit": 5
}
temp.similar_interactions = use_capability("memory", "search", temp.similar_params)

# Learn from patterns
temp.pattern_analysis = reason("Analyze patterns in these interactions: {temp.similar_interactions} compared to current outcome: {temp.outcome}")

# Update strategy based on learning
temp.strategy_update = reason("Based on this pattern analysis, how should the current strategy be updated? {temp.pattern_analysis}")

# Apply learning to future interactions
agent.updated_strategy = temp.strategy_update
log.info("Strategy updated based on experience learning")
"""
```

### 2. Knowledge-based Learning
```python
# Dana program for knowledge-based learning
knowledge_learning = """
# Get current knowledge and new information
temp.knowledge_id = "semiconductor_defect_patterns"
temp.retrieve_params = {"id": temp.knowledge_id}
temp.current_knowledge = use_capability("kb", "retrieve", temp.retrieve_params)
temp.new_information = world.new_defect_data

# Analyze new information against current knowledge
temp.knowledge_analysis = reason("Compare this new information: {temp.new_information} with current knowledge: {temp.current_knowledge}")

# Identify potential knowledge updates
temp.knowledge_updates = reason("What specific updates should be made to the knowledge based on this analysis? {temp.knowledge_analysis}")

# Update knowledge with validations
if temp.knowledge_updates:
    # Validate updates before applying
    temp.validation = reason("Validate these knowledge updates for accuracy and consistency: {temp.knowledge_updates}")
    
    if "valid" in temp.validation.lower():
        # Apply knowledge updates
        temp.update_params = {
            "id": temp.knowledge_id,
            "updates": temp.knowledge_updates,
            "reason": "new_information",
            "confidence": 0.9,
            "validation": temp.validation
        }
        use_capability("kb", "update", temp.update_params)
        log.info("Knowledge updated with new information")
    else:
        log.warning("Knowledge updates failed validation: {temp.validation}")
"""
```

### 3. Feedback-based Learning
```python
# Dana program for feedback-based learning
feedback_learning = """
# Get user feedback and context
temp.feedback = world.user_feedback
temp.interaction_id = world.interaction_id
temp.retrieve_params = {"id": temp.interaction_id}
temp.interaction = use_capability("memory", "retrieve", temp.retrieve_params)

# Analyze feedback for learning opportunities
temp.feedback_analysis = reason("Analyze this user feedback: {temp.feedback} in the context of this interaction: {temp.interaction}")

# Extract actionable insights
temp.insights = reason("Extract specific, actionable insights from this feedback analysis: {temp.feedback_analysis}")

# Apply learnings to behavior
for insight in temp.insights:
    # Determine which aspect to improve
    if "response" in insight.lower():
        # Update response generation
        temp.response_improvement = reason("How should response generation be improved based on this insight: {insight}")
        agent.response_strategies[insight.category] = temp.response_improvement
    elif "knowledge" in insight.lower():
        # Update knowledge
        temp.knowledge_improvement = reason("What knowledge should be updated based on this insight: {insight}")
        temp.update_params = {
            "content": temp.knowledge_improvement,
            "source": "user_feedback",
            "confidence": 0.8
        }
        use_capability("kb", "add_knowledge", temp.update_params)
    elif "process" in insight.lower():
        # Update process
        temp.process_improvement = reason("How should the process be improved based on this insight: {insight}")
        agent.process_improvements.append(temp.process_improvement)

# Log learning outcomes
log.info("Applied learning from feedback: {temp.insights}")
"""
```

## Common Patterns

1. **Feedback Loop Pattern**
   ```python
   # Dana pattern for feedback loops
   feedback_loop = """
   # Collect performance data
   temp.performance = world.task_performance
   temp.expected = agent.expected_performance
   
   # Analyze performance gap
   temp.gap_analysis = reason("Analyze the gap between expected: {temp.expected} and actual performance: {temp.performance}")
   
   # Generate improvement hypotheses
   temp.hypotheses = reason("Generate improvement hypotheses based on this gap analysis: {temp.gap_analysis}")
   
   # Test and implement improvements
   for hypothesis in temp.hypotheses:
       # Store hypothesis for testing
       temp.test_params = {
           "key": "improvement_hypothesis_" + generate_id(),
           "value": hypothesis
       }
       use_capability("memory", "store", temp.test_params)
   
   # Select top hypothesis for implementation
   agent.improvement_plan = reason("Select the most promising improvement from these hypotheses: {temp.hypotheses}")
   """
   ```

2. **Knowledge Evolution Pattern**
   ```python
   # Dana pattern for knowledge evolution
   knowledge_evolution = """
   # Track knowledge application
   temp.applied_knowledge = agent.applied_knowledge
   temp.outcome = world.outcome
   
   # Evaluate knowledge effectiveness
   temp.effectiveness = reason("Evaluate how effectively the applied knowledge: {temp.applied_knowledge} led to this outcome: {temp.outcome}")
   
   # Update knowledge based on effectiveness
   if "ineffective" in temp.effectiveness.lower():
       temp.knowledge_update = reason("How should the knowledge be updated based on this effectiveness evaluation? {temp.effectiveness}")
       temp.update_params = {
           "id": temp.applied_knowledge.id,
           "updates": temp.knowledge_update,
           "reason": "effectiveness_evaluation",
           "confidence": 0.85
       }
       use_capability("kb", "update", temp.update_params)
   """
   ```

3. **Adaptive Strategy Pattern**
   ```python
   # Dana pattern for adaptive strategies
   adaptive_strategy = """
   # Track strategy performance across contexts
   temp.strategy_performance = agent.strategy_performance
   temp.current_context = world.context
   
   # Find optimal strategy for context
   temp.context_analysis = reason("Analyze which strategies perform best in this context: {temp.current_context} based on performance data: {temp.strategy_performance}")
   
   # Select and adapt strategy
   temp.optimal_strategy = reason("Select the optimal strategy for this context and suggest adaptations: {temp.context_analysis}")
   
   # Apply adapted strategy
   agent.current_strategy = temp.optimal_strategy
   """
   ```

## Learning Examples
