  ANALYZE: |
    Objective: {objective}
    
    Let me know all the information you can get from the question.
    You can infer more information based on provided information in the question, but DO NOT hallucinate any information.
    No need to do any task, just analyze the problem and next step will be based on your analysis to construct the plan/solution.
    Please do reasoning to see if it's mandatory to get more extra information to solve the problem.
    If there are any well-known knowledge that would be helpful for the problem, please provide it.
    Do not assume the important information if you are not sure and do not assume customized information (for example, different company will have different level ladder).

  PLAN: |
    Objective: {objective}
    Problem Analysis: {ANALYZE.output}
    
    Based on the above analysis, please construct a plan to solve the problem.
    The plan should be step-by-step, and each step should be clear and actionable.
    
    Think straightforward and logically to generate the plan.
    You should try your best to solve the problem with the information provided in the question and only ask for more information 
    if without it, it's impossible to solve the problem.
    For the simple problem, make simple plan and do not overkill the plan and overcomplicate the plan if not necessary.
    try you best to find the solution with the information provided in the question.
    
    For the step required calculation, please do the calculation step by step and make sure that the calculation is correct. 
    Say the accurate formula before doing the calculation.
    Do not assume the important information if you are not sure and do not assume customized information (for example, different 
    company will have different level ladder). 
    Remember final output is a plan with steps with expected output for each step.
    
    Answer must follow this format:
    step_<i>: step <i> to solve current problem. The step should help me get closer to the solution. Give the necessary 
    information from the question to solve the problem. Just do the thing that essential to solve the problem. Must be in one 
    line, do not use "\n".
    
    expected_output_step_<i>: What do you expect from the output for step <i>. This is just the criteria for the output to make 
    sure that this step is success and can be used to get the accurate answer after gathering all step. Do not specify exact 
    output answer unless you are extremely sure about it. If the step is request to gather information, it must have expected 
    information to be completed. Must be in one line, do not use "\n".

  FINALIZE: |
    These are the reasoning steps and their outputs:
    Reasoning Result: {REASONING.output}
    
    Now, based on the reasoning steps and their outputs above, please give me the comprehensive final answer for the 
    original problem: {objective}.
    Remember to strictly trust in the reasoning steps and their outputs, do not make any assumption or correction the 
    provided reasoning steps and their outputs.
