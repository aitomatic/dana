# Phase 2 Completion Test: Dual Delivery System
# Copyright Â© 2025 Aitomatic, Inc.
# 
# This test demonstrates the successful completion of Phase 2:
# - return statements create lazy Promise[T] objects
# - deliver statements execute eagerly with await all strategy
# - Both mechanisms work seamlessly together
# - Promise transparency for basic operations

# Track execution for timing verification
