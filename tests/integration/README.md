# Integration Tests

This directory contains Python-based integration tests that test multiple components working together.

## Structure

- **`end_to_end/`** - Full system integration tests
  - Complete workflows from start to finish
  - System-wide functionality
  - Real-world usage scenarios
  - Performance and scalability tests

- **`api/`** - API integration tests
  - Server-client communication
  - API protocol compliance
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Error handling and recovery

- **`frameworks/`** - Framework integration tests
  - Framework interoperability
  - Cross-framework communication
  - Framework-specific features
  - Integration with external systems

## Running Integration Tests

```bash
# All integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Specific category
python -m pytest tests/integration/end_to_end/
python -m pytest tests/integration/api/

# With verbose output
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# With coverage
python -m pytest tests/integration/ --cov=dana
```

## Test Guidelines

1. **Realistic**: Test realistic usage scenarios
2. **Setup/Teardown**: Properly set up and clean up test environments
3. **Error Handling**: Test error conditions and recovery
4. **Performance**: Consider performance implications
5. **Isolation**: Tests should not interfere with each other

## Test Categories

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify system behavior under realistic conditions
- Test performance and scalability
- Validate error handling and recovery

### API Tests
- Test API endpoints and protocols
- Verify request/response handling
- Test authentication and authorization
- Validate error responses

### Framework Tests
- Test framework interoperability
- Verify cross-framework communication
- Test framework-specific features
- Validate integration with external systems

## Test Dependencies

Integration tests may require:
- External services (databases, APIs)
- Test data and fixtures
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Proper environment configuration

## Continuous Integration

Integration tests are typically run:
- On pull requests (subset)
- On main branch commits (full suite)
- Before releases (comprehensive testing)
