# Test: Expected Syntax Failures Documentation
# =============================================
# PURPOSE: Document Dana syntax features that seem natural but aren't supported
# SCOPE: Compound assignments, conditional expressions, advanced string operations
# STATUS: Documents potential future enhancements

log("🧪 Testing Expected Syntax Failures Documentation - These Features Don't Work")

log("\n--- Compound Assignment Operators (Not Supported) ---")

# Test 1: Addition assignment operator
log("❌ += operator: total += 5")
log("   Reason: Dana doesn't support compound assignment operators")
log("   Workaround: total = total + 5")
log("   Future consideration: Could be added for convenience")

# Test 2: Multiplication assignment operator  
log("❌ *= operator: value *= 4")
log("   Reason: Dana doesn't support compound assignment operators")
log("   Workaround: value = value * 4")
log("   Future consideration: Could be added for convenience")

# Test 3: String concatenation assignment
log("❌ String += operator: message += ' World'")
log("   Reason: Dana doesn't support compound assignment operators")
log("   Workaround: message = message + ' World'")

# Test 4: List append assignment

# =============================================================================
# CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS (TERNARY OPERATOR)
# =============================================================================
log("\n--- Conditional Expressions (Not Supported) ---")

# Test 5: Simple conditional expression
log("❌ Conditional expression: result = 'positive' if x > 0 else 'non-positive'")
log("   Reason: Dana doesn't support ternary operator syntax")
log("   Workaround: Use if-else statements")
log("   Future consideration: Could improve code conciseness")

# Test 6: Nested conditional expression
log("❌ Nested conditional: grade = 'A' if score >= 90 else 'B' if score >= 80 else 'C'")
log("   Reason: Dana doesn't support ternary operator syntax")
log("   Workaround: Use nested if-elif-else statements")
log("   Future consideration: Could be useful for complex conditions")

# Test 7: Conditional with function call
log("❌ Conditional in function: return 'active' if active else 'inactive'")
log("   Reason: Dana doesn't support ternary operator syntax")
log("   Workaround: Use if-else return statements")
log("   Future consideration: Could improve function brevity")

# =============================================================================
# ADVANCED STRING OPERATIONS
# =============================================================================
log("\n--- Advanced String Operations (Not Supported) ---")

# Test 8: String formatting with % operator
log("❌ % string formatting: 'Hello %s, you are %d years old' % ('Alice', 25)")
log("   Reason: Dana doesn't support % formatting operator")
log("   Workaround: Use f-strings: f'Hello {name}, you are {age} years old'")
log("   Future consideration: Could add for legacy compatibility")

# Test 9: String multiplication
log("❌ String multiplication: 'abc' * 3")
log("   Reason: Dana might not support string multiplication")
log("   Workaround: Use loops or concatenation")
log("   Future consideration: Could be useful for pattern generation")

# Test 10: String method chaining
log("❌ Method chaining: text.strip().lower().replace(' ', '_')")
log("   Reason: Method chaining might have issues in Dana")
log("   Workaround: Use separate method calls")
log("   Future consideration: Could improve code readability")

# =============================================================================
# SLICE ASSIGNMENT
# =============================================================================
log("\n--- Slice Assignment (Not Supported) ---")

# Test 11: List slice assignment
log("❌ List slice assignment: numbers[1:3] = [10, 20]")
log("   Reason: Slice assignment might not work in Dana")
log("   Workaround: Use index-based assignment or list reconstruction")
log("   Future consideration: Could be useful for list modification")

# Test 12: String slice assignment
log("❌ String slice assignment: text[1:3] = 'XY'")
log("   Reason: Strings are immutable, slice assignment not supported")
log("   Workaround: String reconstruction")
log("   Future consideration: Not recommended (strings should be immutable)")

# MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT PATTERNS
# =============================================================================
log("\n--- Multiple Assignment Patterns (Not Supported) ---")

# Test 13: Tuple unpacking assignment
log("❌ Tuple unpacking: a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)")

# Test 14: Starred expressions
log("❌ Starred expressions: first, *middle, last = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]")
log("   Reason: Starred expressions not supported in Dana")
log("   Workaround: Manual slicing and assignment")
log("   Future consideration: Could be useful for flexible unpacking")

# Test 15: Chained assignment
log("❌ Chained assignment: a = b = c = 42")
log("   Reason: Chained assignment might not work in Dana")

log("   Workaround: Separate assignment and condition")
log("   Future consideration: Could reduce code duplication")

# Test 17: Match/case statements
log("❌ Match/case statements: match value: case 1: ...")
log("   Reason: Match statements might not be supported in Dana")
