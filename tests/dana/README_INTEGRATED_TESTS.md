# Dana Integrated Tests

## Overview and Current Status

This directory contains comprehensive integrated tests for the Dana language that go beyond simple unit tests to validate real-world usage patterns. These tests are designed to reveal issues with nested conditionals, complex data structures, business workflows, and multi-component interactions.

**🎯 Current Status: Phase 1 Complete**
- ✅ **2 Core Tests Passing**: Nested conditionals and financial workflows
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure Established**: Complete directory structure and test runners
- ✅ **Major Syntax Issues Resolved**: Dana language compatibility fixes applied
- 🚧 **Phase 2 In Progress**: Addressing remaining higher-order function limitations

## Quick Start

### Running All Integrated Tests
```bash
# Run all new integrated tests

# Run legacy tests (moved from original locations)
uv run pytest tests/dana/legacy/ -v
```

### Running Individual Test Categories
```bash
# Language features (nested conditionals, etc.)

**Legend**: ✅ Passing | 🚧 In Progress | 📋 Planned

## Test Descriptions

### ✅ Currently Passing Tests

#### `test_nested_conditionals_with_structs.na`
**Purpose**: Validates complex conditional logic with struct field access
- **Business Logic**: Access control system with role-based permissions
- **Dana Features**: Nested if/elif/else, struct instantiation, field access, complex boolean logic
- **Test Coverage**: 
  - Multi-level access control (admin/manager/employee roles)
  - Location-based permissions (office vs remote)
  - Security clearance validation
  - User status checking (active/inactive)
  - Complex business rule combinations

#### `test_loan_application_workflow.na`  
**Purpose**: Financial services workflow with POET integration
- **Business Logic**: Complete loan application processing pipeline
- **Dana Features**: POET decorators, complex calculations, struct composition
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Comprehensive struct definitions (CreditHistory, Income, Assets, etc.)
  - Business function implementations (DTI ratio, LTV calculations)
  - POET-enhanced risk assessment and compliance checking
  - Decision engine with conditional logic
  - Real-world financial domain patterns

### 🚧 Currently Failing Tests (Known Issues)

#### `test_company_employee_management.na`
**Issue**: String method compatibility ("Object of type builtin_function_or_method has no method replace")
- **Status**: Dana string operations need investigation
- **Workaround**: Alternative string handling approaches being explored

#### `test_pipe_operator_context_fix.na`
**Issue**: Higher-order function assignments in pipe operations
- **Status**: "Invalid pipe operation: right operand must be a function" errors
- **Workaround**: Direct function calls work, assignments return None

## Dana Language Compatibility Fixes Applied

### Syntax Issues Resolved ✅

1. **Compound Assignment Operators**:
   ```dana
   # ❌ Not supported
   total += value
   
   # ✅ Use instead  
   total = total + value
   ```

2. **Conditional Expressions**:
   ```dana
   # ❌ Not supported
   result = value if condition else default
   
   # ✅ Use instead
   result = default
   if condition:
       result = value
   ```

3. **Membership Testing**:
   ```dana
   # ❌ Not supported  
   if item not in collection:
   
   # ✅ Use instead
   if not (item in collection):
   ```

4. **Inline Comments with Operators**:
   ```dana
   # ❌ Not supported
   total = value1 + value2  # comment here
   
   # ✅ Use instead
   # Comment on separate line
   total = value1 + value2
   ```

### Known Limitations 🚧

1. **Higher-Order Function Assignments**: Function assignment variables may return `None`
2. **String Method Operations**: Some Python string methods may not be available
3. **Complex Pipe Operations**: Nested function calls in pipes need refinement

## Development Guidelines

### Creating New Tests

1. **Use `.na` files** for Dana-specific functionality testing
2. **Follow naming convention**: `test_*.na` for automatic discovery
3. **Include comprehensive logging** with `log()` statements for debugging
4. **Test both success and error paths**
5. **Use real-world business scenarios** when possible

### Test Template

```dana
# test_my_feature.na
log("🧪 Testing My Feature")

# Test setup
log("\n--- Setting up test data ---")
# ... setup code ...

# Test execution  
log("\n--- Testing core functionality ---")
# ... test code with assertions ...

# Test edge cases
log("\n--- Testing edge cases ---")  
# ... edge case testing ...

log("✅ All tests passed!")
log("🎉 My Feature test completed successfully!")
```

### Assertion Patterns

```dana
# Boolean assertions
assert condition == true
assert result != null

# Numeric assertions  
assert count == 5
assert total >= 100.0

# String assertions
assert name == "expected_value"
assert f"Got: {result}" # for debugging

# Collection assertions
assert len(items) > 0
assert item in collection
```

## Running Instructions

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run just the passing tests for quick validation
uv run pytest tests/dana/integration/language_features/ tests/dana/scenarios/financial_services/ -v

# 2. Run all tests to see current status
uv run pytest tests/dana/integration/ tests/dana/scenarios/ tests/dana/regression/ -v

# 3. Run specific test file directly with Dana
dana tests/dana/integration/language_features/test_nested_conditionals_with_structs.na

# 4. Debug with verbose output
dana --debug tests/dana/integration/language_features/test_nested_conditionals_with_structs.na
```

### Continuous Integration

```bash
# Full test suite (includes legacy tests)
uv run pytest tests/dana/ -v

# Just new integrated tests (faster)
uv run pytest tests/dana/integration/ tests/dana/scenarios/ tests/dana/regression/ -v
```
