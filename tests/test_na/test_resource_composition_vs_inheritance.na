    state: str = "CREATED"

struct DatabaseResourceCore:
    connection_string: str
    max_connections: int = 10

# Resource using composition instead of inheritance

print("✅ Composition approach could work")

print("\n=== Comparing the Approaches ===")

print("Inheritance Benefits:")
print("  ✅ Automatic field merging")
print("  ✅ Method inheritance")
print("  ✅ Clean syntax")
print("  ✅ Familiar OOP patterns")
print("  ✅ Built-in state management")

print("\nComposition Benefits:")
print("  ✅ Consistent with structs")
print("  ✅ More explicit relationships")
print("  ✅ Flexible composition")
print("  ✅ No inheritance complexity")
print("  ✅ Better separation of concerns")

print("\n=== Testing Composition Approach ===")

# Test the composition approach
base_core = BaseResourceCore()
db_core = DatabaseResourceCore(
    connection_string = "postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb",
    max_connections = 20
)

print("Base core fields:")
print("  state:", base_core.state)

print("Database core fields:")
print("  connection_string:", db_core.connection_string)
print("  max_connections:", db_core.max_connections)

print("\n=== Delegation Would Work Like This ===")

# If we used delegation, it would work like structs
struct ComposedResource:
    _base: BaseResourceCore
    _database: DatabaseResourceCore
    name: str

# This would enable:
# composed_resource.state      # Delegated from _base
# composed_resource.connection_string  # Delegated from _database
# composed_resource.name       # Direct field

print("✅ Delegation would provide the same benefits as inheritance")

print("\n=== Analysis: Do We Need Inheritance? ===")

print("Arguments FOR keeping inheritance:")
print("  📝 Resources are more complex than structs")
print("  📝 Lifecycle management benefits from inheritance")
print("  📝 Method inheritance is cleaner than delegation")
print("  📝 Familiar OOP patterns for developers")
print("  📝 Automatic state field injection")

print("\nArguments AGAINST inheritance (for composition):")
print("  📝 Inconsistency with structs")
print("  📝 Composition is more flexible")
print("  📝 Delegation already provides the same benefits")
print("  📝 Simpler type system")
print("  📝 Better separation of concerns")
print("  📝 More explicit relationships")

print("\n=== Key Question ===")

print("🤔 The fundamental question is:")
print("  'Is the convenience of inheritance worth the inconsistency?'")

print("\nCurrent state:")
print("  - Structs: Composition + Delegation (no inheritance)")
print("  - Resources: Inheritance (no composition)")
print("  - Agents: No inheritance (like structs)")

print("\nIf we removed resource inheritance:")
print("  - Structs: Composition + Delegation")
print("  - Resources: Composition + Delegation")
print("  - Agents: No inheritance")
print("  - Result: Complete consistency!")

print("\n=== Technical Feasibility ===")

print("✅ YES - Resources could work with composition/delegation:")
print("  - Replace inheritance with underscore fields")
print("  - Use delegation for field access")
print("  - Use method registry for methods")
print("  - Maintain all current functionality")

print("\nExample transformation:")
print("  Before: resource Child(Parent): fields...")
print("  After:  resource Child: _parent: Parent, fields...")

print("\n=== Recommendation ===")

print("🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Remove resource inheritance for consistency")
print("  Benefits:")
print("    - Complete language consistency")
print("    - Simpler type system")
print("    - Better separation of concerns")
print("    - More explicit relationships")
print("    - Delegation already provides all benefits")

print("  Trade-offs:")
print("    - Slightly more verbose resource definitions")
print("    - Need to migrate existing code")
print("    - Less familiar OOP patterns")

print("\n=== Conclusion ===")
print("You're absolutely right! Resources don't need inheritance.")
print("Composition + delegation can provide the same benefits")
print("while making Dana completely consistent.")
print("This would be a significant improvement to the language design.")
