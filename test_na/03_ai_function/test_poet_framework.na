# Test: POET Framework Integration - [NOT WORKING YET] this is a work in progress
# Purpose: Test Dana's POET (Perceive-Operate-Enforce-Train) framework including:
#   - Basic POET decorator functionality
#   - Domain-specific enhancements
#   - Type conversion and validation
#   - Pipeline composition with POET
#   - Error handling and retries
# Category: Integration - POET Framework
