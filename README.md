## TL;DR - Get Running in 30 Seconds! 🚀

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aitomatic/opendxa.git
cd opendxa
make  # This installs everything and creates your .env file
```

Then:
1. Add your API key to `.env` 
2. Run `make dana` to start the Dana REPL (interactive shell)

## 🚀 What is OpenDXA?

OpenDXA (Domain-eXpert Agent) Framework transforms AI development from brittle, unpredictable systems to reliable, auditable automations. Built on the Dana language - an agent-native neurosymbolic programming environment - OpenDXA enables intelligent multi-agent systems with domain expertise.

### ✨ Key Benefits
- **🔍 Transparent**: Every step is visible and debuggable through imperative programming
- **🛡️ Reliable**: Built-in verification and error correction with structured state management
- **⚡ Fast**: 10x faster development cycles with clear control flow
- **🤝 Collaborative**: Share and reuse working solutions across domains
- **🧠 Domain-Aware**: Seamless integration of specialized knowledge and expertise
- **🤖 Agent-Native**: Purpose-built for multi-agent systems with first-class agent primitives

### 🎯 Core Innovation: Dana Language

Dana (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture) provides an agent-native imperative programming model for agent reasoning:

```python
# Traditional AI: Opaque, brittle
result = llm_call("analyze data", context=data)

# Dana: Transparent, self-correcting with explicit state management
analysis = reason("analyze data", context=data)  # Auto-scoped to local (preferred)
while confidence(analysis) < high_confidence:
    analysis = reason("refine analysis", context=[data, analysis])

# Clear state transitions and auditable reasoning
public:result = analysis
use("tools.report.generate", input=public:result)
```

### 🏗️ Core Components

OpenDXA consists of three primary components built on agent-native architecture:

1. **OpenDXA Framework** - Orchestrates Dana and DANKE components, manages agent lifecycle
2. **Dana Language** - Agent-native universal program format and runtime for agent reasoning
3. **DANKE Engine** - Knowledge management implementing the CORRAL methodology: Collect, Organize, Retrieve, Reason, Act, Learn
