## What is DXA?

DXA is a framework for building intelligent agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It specializes in embedding domain expertise into agents through a unique three-layer architecture that maps business workflows to concrete plans to reasoning patterns:

1. **Workflows (WHY)** define what agents can do - from simple Q&A to complex research patterns
2. **Plans (WHAT)** break down workflows into concrete, executable steps
3. **Reasoning (HOW)** executes each step using appropriate thinking patterns

    subgraph "Layer Architecture"
        direction LR
        W[Workflow Layer<br>WHY] --> P[Planning Layer<br>WHAT]
        P --> R[Reasoning Layer<br>HOW]
    end
```

This architecture means you can:

- Start simple (like basic Q&A)
- Add capabilities progressively
- Scale to complex domain-specific tasks
- Maintain clean separation of concerns

## Component Overview

DXA consists of several core components that work together:

- **Agent System** - Executes workflows and manages resources

which executes workflows and manages resources in a 3-layer architecture, all of which can be specified as data structures or in natural language, or dynamically generated by the agent itself:

- **Workflow System** - Defines what agents can do
- **Planning System** - Converts workflows to executable plans
- **Reasoning System** - Executes plans with appropriate thinking patterns

Agents have built-in **Capabilities** and connections to external tools via the **Resource System**. They communicate with the outside world via the **IO System**.

- **Capability System** - Defines the core capabilities of the agent, such as memory, expertise
- **Resource System** - Integrates external tools and capabilities
- **IO System** - Handles input and output for the agent

## Key Features

- **Domain Expertise Integration** - Embed expert knowledge into agent behavior
- **Progressive Complexity** - Start simple, scale to complex tasks
- **Composable Architecture** - Mix and match capabilities as needed
- **Built-in Best Practices** - Pre-configured templates for common patterns
- **Full Customization** - Complete control when needed

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dxa-prototype
bash setup_env.sh
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
```

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- bash shell (Unix) or Git Bash (Windows)

## Quick Start

```python
from dxa.core.agent import Agent
from dxa.core.workflow import create_research_workflow

# Simple Q&A
answer = Agent().ask("What is quantum computing?")

# Research workflow
workflow = create_research_workflow()
agent = Agent(resources={"llm": LLMResource()})
result = agent.execute(workflow)

# Custom workflow with resources
agent = Agent(resources={
    "llm": LLMResource(model="gpt-4"),
    "search": SearchResource()
})
result = agent.execute(workflow)
```

## Strategic Framework Selection Matrix

DXA provides distinct advantages in several key areas when compared to other agent frameworks:

| Use Case | DXA | LangChain | AutoGPT | BabyAGI |
|----------|-----|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Quick Start** | ✨ Template-based initialization | Direct chain construction | Command interface | Simple task queue |
| **Simple Tasks** | ✨ Pre-configured templates | Chain composition | Command sequences | Task scheduling |
| **Complex Tasks** | ✨ Full cognitive architecture | Multiple chains | Command sequences | Task recursion |
| **Domain Expertise** | ✨ Built-in expertise system | Tool integration | Command-based tools | Task-based tools |
| **Autonomous Operation** | ✨ Structured autonomy | Chain automation | Free-form commands | Task loops |
| **Growth Path** | ✨ Seamless capability expansion | Chain rebuilding | New commands | New tasks |

✨ = Optimal choice for category

### Framework Selection Guide

| Need | Best Choice | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
