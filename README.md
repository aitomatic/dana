<!--
⚠️ IMPORTANT FOR AI CODE GENERATORS:
Always use colon notation for explicit scopes: `private:x`, `public:x`, `system:x`, `local:x`
NEVER use dot notation: `private.x`, `public.x`, etc.
Prefer using unscoped variables (auto-scoped to local) instead of explicit `private:` scope unless private scope is specifically needed.

# OpenDXA - Domain-Expert Agent Framework

> A comprehensive framework for easily coding and deploying smart, multi-agent systems with domain expertise, powered by Dana, a Pythonic agentic programming language and secure sandboxed runtime.

## TL;DR

### Requirements
- [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### Steps

In your terminal, run the following.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aitomatic/opendxa.git

# Go to the folder
cd opendxa

# Set up the virtual environment
uv sync
```

Add your API key of choice to your .env file.

```bash
# Create your .env file
cp .env.template .env

# Open the file to edit it
open .env 
```

Now you can start the DANA shell, just like Python!

```bash
uv run bin/dana
```

## 🚀 What is OpenDXA?

OpenDXA (Domain-eXpert Agent) Framework transforms AI development from brittle, unpredictable systems to reliable, auditable automations. Built on the Dana language - a neurosymbolic programming environment - OpenDXA enables intelligent multi-agent systems with domain expertise.

### ✨ Key Benefits
- **🔍 Transparent**: Every step is visible and debuggable through imperative programming
- **🛡️ Reliable**: Built-in verification and error correction with structured state management
- **⚡ Fast**: 10x faster development cycles with clear control flow
- **🤝 Collaborative**: Share and reuse working solutions across domains
- **🧠 Domain-Aware**: Seamless integration of specialized knowledge and expertise

### 🎯 Core Innovation: Dana Language

Dana (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture) provides an imperative programming model for agent reasoning:

```python
# Traditional AI: Opaque, brittle
result = llm_call("analyze data", context=data)

# Dana: Transparent, self-correcting with explicit state management
analysis = reason("analyze data", context=data)  # Auto-scoped to local (preferred)
while confidence(analysis) < high_confidence:
    analysis = reason("refine analysis", context=[data, analysis])

# Clear state transitions and auditable reasoning
public:result = analysis
use("tools.report.generate", input=public:result)
```

### 🏗️ Core Components

OpenDXA consists of three primary components:

1. **OpenDXA Framework** - Orchestrates Dana and DANKE components, manages agent lifecycle
2. **Dana Language** - Universal program format and runtime for agent reasoning
3. **DANKE Engine** - Knowledge management implementing the CORRAL methodology: Collect, Organize, Retrieve, Reason, Act, Learn
