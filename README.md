## TL;DR - Get Running in 30 Seconds! üöÄ
### One-Command Setup
```bash
% git clone https://github.com/aitomatic/opendxa.git
% cd opendxa
% make # This will check for uv and install it if missing, then set up everything.
```
This installs everything and creates your `.env` file. Then just:
1. Add your API key to `.env` 
2. Run `bin/dana` to start the Dana REPL (interactive shell)

---

### Manual Setup (if you prefer)
**1. Install uv (if not already installed):**
```bash
% curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh # Install uv
```
For other installation methods, see the [official uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

**2. Setup OpenDXA:**
```bash
% git clone https://github.com/aitomatic/opendxa.git && cd opendxa && uv sync --extra dev --extra docs # Setup OpenDXA & install dev/docs dependencies
% cp .env.example .env # Configure your API keys
% bin/dana # Start the Dana REPL
```

- First time using uv? See [Development Setup & Project Maintenance with uv](#development-setup--project-maintenance-with-uv) for essential commands.

## üöÄ What is OpenDXA?

OpenDXA (Domain-eXpert Agent) Framework transforms AI development from brittle, unpredictable systems to reliable, auditable automations. Built on the Dana language - a neurosymbolic programming environment - OpenDXA enables intelligent multi-agent systems with domain expertise.

### ‚ú® Key Benefits
- **üîç Transparent**: Every step is visible and debuggable through imperative programming
- **üõ°Ô∏è Reliable**: Built-in verification and error correction with structured state management
- **‚ö° Fast**: 10x faster development cycles with clear control flow
- **ü§ù Collaborative**: Share and reuse working solutions across domains
- **üß† Domain-Aware**: Seamless integration of specialized knowledge and expertise

### üéØ Core Innovation: Dana Language

Dana (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic Architecture) provides an imperative programming model for agent reasoning:

```python
# Traditional AI: Opaque, brittle
result = llm_call("analyze data", context=data)

# Dana: Transparent, self-correcting with explicit state management
analysis = reason("analyze data", context=data)  # Auto-scoped to local (preferred)
while confidence(analysis) < high_confidence:
    analysis = reason("refine analysis", context=[data, analysis])

# Clear state transitions and auditable reasoning
public:result = analysis
use("tools.report.generate", input=public:result)
```

### üèóÔ∏è Core Components

OpenDXA consists of three primary components:

1. **OpenDXA Framework** - Orchestrates Dana and DANKE components, manages agent lifecycle
2. **Dana Language** - Universal program format and runtime for agent reasoning
3. **DANKE Engine** - Knowledge management implementing the CORRAL methodology: Collect, Organize, Retrieve, Reason, Act, Learn

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

This project uses `uv` for managing dependencies and running development tasks.

### Initial Setup

1.  **Install uv**: If you haven't already, install uv. The `make` command in the quickstart will handle this, or you can do it manually:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
    For other installation methods, see the [official uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aitomatic/opendxa.git
    cd opendxa
    ```
3.  **Sync dependencies & Set up pre-commit hooks**:
    ```bash
    # Install all dependencies, including optional 'dev' and 'docs' groups, and set up pre-commit hooks
    make setup-dev 
    # or, if you prefer to run uv commands directly:
    # uv sync --extra dev --extra docs
    # uv run pre-commit install
    ```
    Our `dev` and `docs` dependencies are specified under `[project.optional-dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`.
4.  **Configure environment**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Then, add your API keys to .env
    ```

### Common Development Tasks

Most common development tasks are available via `make` commands, which wrap `uv run ...` commands. As `uv`'s task runner capabilities evolve, direct `uv run <task_name>` might become more prevalent.

**Using `make` (Recommended):**
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Fast tests only (excluding 'live' and 'deep' tests)
make test-fast

# Live/integration tests only
make test-live

# Run tests with coverage report
make coverage

# Lint code
make lint

# Lint and auto-fix
make fix

# Format code (Black)
make format

# Check formatting (Black)
make check-format

# Type checking (MyPy)
make mypy

# Live preview docs during writing
make docs-serve

# Live preview docs (remote accessible)
make docs-serve-remote

# Build docs
make docs-build

# Build docs with warnings as errors
make docs-build-strict

# Build and deploy docs to GitHub Pages
make docs-deploy

# Test code examples in docstrings
make doctest

# Check all markdown links
make linkcheck

# Documentation style checking (doc8)
make doc8

# Run a Dana script (example)
make run-dana SCRIPT=examples/dana/debug_tests/test_basic.na

# Start the Dana REPL
make repl
```

**Direct `uv run` commands (for reference or if `make` is not available):**

The `Makefile` contains aliases for these `uv run` commands. For example, `make test` runs `uv run pytest tests/`.

#### Testing Workflows
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Fast tests only (excluding 'live' and 'deep' tests)
uv run pytest -m 'not live and not deep' tests/

# Live/integration tests only
uv run pytest -m 'live' tests/

# Run tests with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=opendxa --cov-report=html tests/
```

#### Code Quality Workflows
```bash
# Lint code
uv run ruff check .

# Lint and auto-fix
uv run ruff check --fix .

# Format code
uv run black .

# Check formatting
uv run black --check .

# Type checking
uv run mypy .
```

#### Documentation Workflows (for DevRel team)
```bash
# Live preview during writing
uv run python -m mkdocs serve

# Live preview (remote accessible)
uv run python -m mkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000

# Build docs
uv run python -m mkdocs build

# Build with warnings as errors
uv run python -m mkdocs build --strict
```

#### Deploying to GitHub Pages
To deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages, ensure your `mkdocs.yml` is configured correctly for the GitHub Pages repository and then run:

```bash
# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
uv run mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to push to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

#### Documentation Validation (Catch Staleness)
```bash
# Test code examples in docstrings
uv run pytest --doctest-modules opendxa/

# Check all markdown links (fast async)
uv run python -m linkcheckmd docs/

# Documentation style checking
uv run doc8 docs/

# Validate complete build (same as build --strict)
uv run python -m mkdocs build --strict
```

#### Dana-Specific Commands
```bash
# Run a Dana script
uv run python -m opendxa.dana.exec.dana examples/dana/debug_tests/test_basic.na

# Start the Dana REPL
uv run python -m opendxa.dana.exec.repl.repl
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Maintenance with uv

`uv` is also used for managing project dependencies. Here are some essential commands:

### Environment Management
```bash
# Sync dependencies with pyproject.toml (installs new, removes unused)
uv sync

# Sync with development dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Sync with documentation tool dependencies
uv sync --extra docs

# Sync with all optional dependencies
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs

# Add a new production dependency
uv add <package_name>

# Add a new development dependency
uv add --group dev <package_name>

# Remove a dependency
uv remove <package_name>
```
The `pyproject.toml` also mentions `[project.optional-dependencies]` for `dev` and `docs`.
Make sure these are covered when syncing.
