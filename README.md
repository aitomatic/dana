# DXA Prototype

A prototype implementation of DXA (Domain-Expert Agents) - an AI-powered system for domain-specific expert agents.

For detailed architecture documentation (Product-Engineering perspective), see [DXA Architecture](dxa/README.md). For usage examples (AI Solution Engineering perspective), check out our [Examples](examples/README.md).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- bash shell (for Unix-based systems) or Git Bash (for Windows)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dxa-prototype
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   bash setup_env.sh
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

3. Configure the environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if not already done)
   - Update the values in `.env` with your configuration

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python dxa-poc.py
   ```
