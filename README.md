# DXA - Domain-Expert Agent Framework

## Reasoning System

DXA provides four core reasoning patterns, from simplest to most complex:

### 1. Direct Reasoning
- Simple command execution
- No complex planning
- Best for straightforward tasks

```python
agent = Agent("simple").with_reasoning("direct")
# or
agent = Agent("simple").with_reasoning(ReasoningLevel.DIRECT)
```

### 2. Chain of Thought (CoT)
- Linear step-by-step reasoning
- Explicit thought process
- Best for problem decomposition

```python
agent = Agent("thinker").with_reasoning("cot")
# or
from dxa.core.reasoning import ChainOfThoughtReasoning
agent = Agent("thinker").with_reasoning(ChainOfThoughtReasoning())
```

### 3. OODA Loop
- Cyclical, adaptive reasoning
- Continuous situation assessment
- Best for dynamic environments

```python
agent = Agent("adaptive").with_reasoning("ooda")
# or
agent = Agent("adaptive").with_reasoning(ReasoningLevel.OODA)
```

### 4. DANA (Domain-Aware NeuroSymbolic)
- Hybrid neural-symbolic reasoning
- LLM for understanding, Python for execution
- Best for computational tasks

```python
agent = Agent("hybrid").with_reasoning("dana")
# or
from dxa.core.reasoning import DANAReasoning
agent = Agent("hybrid").with_reasoning(DANAReasoning())
```

## Example Usage

```python
from dxa.agent import Agent
from dxa.core.resource import LLMResource

# Create agent with specific reasoning
agent = Agent("solver")\
    .with_reasoning("cot")\
    .with_resources({
        "llm": LLMResource(model="gpt-4")
    })

# Run task
result = await agent.run({
    "objective": "Solve this problem",
    "command": "Calculate X"
})
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- bash shell (for Unix-based systems) or Git Bash (for Windows)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dxa-prototype
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   bash setup_env.sh
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

3. Configure the environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if not already done)
   - Update the values in `.env` with your configuration

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python dxa-poc.py
   ```

## Configuration

The application requires the following configuration:

- Environment variables in `.env` file
- API key configuration in the main Python file

## Notes

- Make sure all dependencies are properly installed before running the application
- For any issues, please check the troubleshooting section or contact the development team

## About DXA

Domain-Expert Agents (DXA) is a system designed to create and manage AI agents that specialize in specific domains or areas of expertise. These agents can provide domain-specific knowledge, answer questions, and assist with tasks within their area of specialization.
