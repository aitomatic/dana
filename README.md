# DXA - Domain-Expert Agent Framework

DXA is a framework for building and deploying intelligent agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). These agents combine cognitive abilities, domain expertise, and external resources to solve complex problems.

## Documentation Map

The DXA framework documentation is organized by component:

### Framework Core

- [Framework Overview](dxa/README.md) - System architecture and design
- [Common Utilities](dxa/common/README.md) - Shared functionality and tools

### Components

- [Agent System](dxa/agent/README.md) - Agent implementation and runtime
- [Reasoning System](dxa/core/reasoning/README.md) - Decision-making patterns
- [Resource System](dxa/core/resource/README.md) - External tool integration
- [I/O System](dxa/core/io/README.md) - Environment interaction
- [Capability System](dxa/core/capability/README.md) - Agent abilities
- [Expert System](dxa/expert/README.md) - Domain expertise integration

### Development

- [Examples](examples/README.md) - Implementation examples and patterns
- [Tests](tests/README.md) - Test suite and coverage
- [API Documentation](docs/README.md) - API reference and guides

Each component's README provides:

- Detailed architecture
- Usage examples
- Interface documentation
- Best practices

## Quick Start

1. Prerequisites:
   - Python 3.x
   - bash shell (Unix) or Git Bash (Windows)

2. Installation:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dxa-prototype
   bash setup_env.sh
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

3. Basic Usage:

   ```python
   from dxa.agent import Agent
   from dxa.core.resource import LLMResource

   agent = Agent("assistant")\
       .with_reasoning("cot")\
       .with_resources({"llm": LLMResource(model="gpt-4")})
   
   result = await agent.run("Help with this task")
   ```
